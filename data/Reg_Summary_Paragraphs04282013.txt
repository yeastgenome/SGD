YKL112W	ABF1	ABF1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that binds the consensus site, 5'-TnnCGTnnnnnnTGAT-3', which is found at various locations throughout the genome including at the silent mating type loci, ARSs, telomeres, and the promoter regions of many genes. Abf1p binding to these sites directly mediates a number of different events in addition to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation such as DNA replication, silencing, and nucleotide excision repair. Abf1p regulates transcription of over 80 genes involved in a diverse range of cellular processes such as sugar and carbohydrate metabolism (ex. ADH1, CDC19, PGK1, ENO1, ENO2), nitrogen utilization (ex. CAR1, CAR2), ascospore formation (ex. SPR3), meiosis (ex. HOP1), ribosomal function (ex. RPL2A, RPL2B), and cellular respiration (ex. COX6). Abf1p contains a bipartite N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal activation domain, which is responsible for mediating nuclear localization and chromatin remodeling. Abf1p binding appears to be constitutive and is stimulated by DNA replication protein Cdc6p. Abf1p can repress its own transcription through binding to its own promoter. Abf1p contains multiple phosphorylation sites, with the extent of Abf1p phosphorylation varying in different growth conditions, and regulating its activity.	8721998|8649386|9032242|1917865|2201905|2120676|7663308|10601031|16083878|15192094
YER045C	ACA1	ACA1 encodes a transcriptional activator of the ATF/CREB family, containing a bZIP structural motif which consists of a leucine zipper that mediates dimerization and an adjacent basic region that contacts DNA. Aca1p binds as a homodimer to the ATF/CREB consensus sequence TGACGTCA, and with comparable efficiency to ATF/CREB sites with single or double substitutions at positions +/- 2. Aca1p can also bind ATF/CREB sites as a heterodimer with Cst6p. Aca1p is important for carbon source utilization. Target genes include GRE2 and COS8.	10825197|12051917
YLR131C	ACE2	ACE2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. At the end of mitosis, Ace2p acts specifically in daughter cells to activate transcription of genes such as CTS1, SCW11, DSE2, DSE3, and DSE4, encoding chitinases and glucanases that are required to destroy the septum and allow mother and daughter cells to separate after budding. It also activates expression of BUD9 and DSE1, both involved in bud site selection. Ace2p also represses transcription of the G1 cyclin Cln3p, causing daughter cells to have a lengthened G1 period to allow sufficient growth before budding. Ace2p activity is regulated by its nuclear localization, which in turn is controlled by phosphorylation. During anaphase and early telophase, phosphorylation of the nuclear localization sites of Ace2p, mediated by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase, prevents Ace2p from entering the nucleus. In late telophase, these sites are dephosphorylated by Cdc14p, allowing Ace2p to enter both mother and daughter nuclei. Its nuclear export sequence (NES) is then phosphorylated by Cbk1p specifically in daughter cell nuclei, causing Ace2p to accumulate there. Phosphorylation by Cbk1p at an additional site increases transcription activation by Ace2p. Later in G1, the NES of Ace2p is dephosphorylated, allowing Ace2p to exit the nucleus, after which it is sequestered in the cytoplasm. Ace2p has a paralog, Swi5p, which also acts at the end of mitosis but regulates a distinct set of genes.	23212898
YCL058W-A	ADF1	ADF1 is an antisense gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor of the sense gene FYV5 coded on the opposite strand.  Adf1p negatively regulates the expression of FYV5 by binding its promoter, revealing a novel molecular mechanism of interaction between a pair of sense and antisense genes.  Fyv5p regulates the mating pathway by binding to MATalpha2p, one of the determinants of yeast mating types, thereby suppressing mating behavior and allowing quick vegetative growth. The expression level of ADF1 fluctuates, suggesting a dynamic regulatory circuit in response to changes in physiological conditions.	20195295
YDR216W	ADR1	ADR1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Adr1p binds to promoters as a monomer in the absence of glucose to activate transcription of genes required for utilization of non-glucose carbon sources. Its targets include genes involved in catabolism of nonfermentable carbon sources such as ethanol, glycerol, and lactate (e.g., ADH2, ACS1, and GUT1), and also genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis and fatty acid utilization (e.g., POX1 and PXA1). In addition, binding of Adr1p to subtelomeric sites may affect the boundaries of silenced regions. Adr1p is part of the regulatory network controlling glucose repression and its alleviation in the absence of glucose, and as such, its expression and activity are tightly regulated by multiple glucose-response signals.	19686338||22687600|22964838|18791642|21206489
YGL071W	AFT1	AFT1 and AFT2 encode paralogous low-iron-sensing transcriptional activators that regulate the expression of iron uptake and storage genes. Aft1p and Aft2p activate gene expression under iron-deficient conditions by binding to the same promoter elements, containing 5'-RCACCC-3' motifs. Aft1p is considered the primary regulator of iron homeostasis, but Aft2 can partially compensate for the loss of Aft1. The activities of Aft1p and Aft2p are regulated by monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3p and Grx4p, and exportin Msn5p. Aft1p cycles between the nucleus and cytosol, favoring cytosolic localization under iron-replete conditions, which induce multimerization of Aft1p/2p and favor export from the nucleus via interaction with the exportin Msn5p. Under low-iron conditions, Aft1p and Aft2p accumulates in the nucleus where it binds to and activates genes involved in iron uptake, transport, and storage, known collectively as the iron regulon.	17074835|22583368
YPL202C	AFT2	AFT1 and AFT2 encode paralogous low-iron-sensing transcriptional activators that regulate the expression of iron uptake and storage genes. Aft1p and Aft2p activate gene expression under iron-deficient conditions by binding to the same promoter elements, containing 5'-RCACCC-3' motifs. Aft1p is considered the primary regulator of iron homeostasis, but Aft2 can partially compensate for the loss of Aft1. The activities of Aft1p and Aft2p are regulated by monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3p and Grx4p, and exportin Msn5p. Aft1p cycles between the nucleus and cytosol, favoring cytosolic localization under iron-replete conditions, which induce multimerization of Aft1p/2p and favor export from the nucleus via interaction with the exportin Msn5p. Under low-iron conditions, Aft1p and Aft2p accumulates in the nucleus where it binds to and activates genes involved in iron uptake, transport, and storage, known collectively as the iron regulon.	17074835|22583368
YMR042W	ARG80	ARG80 encodes an alpha helix transcription factor of the MADS box family.  Arg80p binds 5'-WGACKC-3' motifs, and is required for the repression of arginine biosynthetic genes (ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6 and ARG8) and induction of arginine catabolic genes (CAR1 and CAR2) in response to arginine. Regulation of arginine-dependent gene expression is mediated by the multimeric ArgR/Mcm1 complex that binds upstream regulatory motifs in the promoters of arginine-sensitive promoters. The ArgR/Mcm1 complex consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p, and Mcm1p. Arg80p and Mcm1p form heterodimers and coregulate gene expression by facilitating the cooperative binding of diverse sequence-specific factors to promoters. Arg81p facilitates the arginine-dependent recruitment of the Arg80p-Mcm1p heterodimers to promoters. Expression of ARG80 is regulated by Gcn4p, and Gcn4p may also facilitate the binding of the Arg80p-Mcm1p heterodimer to target promoters.	14563547|22419079
YML099C	ARG81	ARG81 encodes a zinc-coordinating transcription factor of the zinc cluster family. Arg81p binds 5'-MTGACTCH-3' motifs, and is required for the repression of arginine biosynthetic genes (ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6 and ARG8) and induction of arginine catabolic genes (CAR1 and CAR2) in response to arginine. Regulation of arginine-dependent gene expression is mediated by the multimeric ArgR/Mcm1 complex that binds upstream regulatory motifs in the promoters of arginine-sensitive promoters. The ArgR/Mcm1 complex consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p, and Mcm1p.  Arg81p is the sensor of arginine, and facilitates the arginine-dependent recruitment of Arg80p-Mcm1p heterodimers to promoters. 	14563547|22419079
YDR421W	ARO80	ARO80 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Aro80p activates transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in aromatic amino acid catabolism, such as ARO9 and ARO10. Aro80p is activated by the aromatic alcohol tryptophol, which is produced by ARO9 and ARO10, creating a positive feedback loop. Tryptophol serves as a quorum sensing signal in yeast: it is secreted at high population density, and promotes the transition to filamentous growth. Thus Aro80p has roles in cell density sensing and regulation of morphogenesis in addition to regulation of aromatic amino acid catabolism.	16959962|20024075|16618799
YPR199C	ARR1	ARR1 encodes an AP-1 type transcription factor which contains a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), and binds to a consensus cis-acting Yap recognition element (YRE; 5'-TTAC/GTAA-3'). Arr1p is the master regulator of the arsenic stress response, mediating transcriptional activation of the ARR2 arsenate reductase and the ARR3 plasma membrane arsenite antiporter, thereby facilitating extrusion of arsenite molecules from the cytoplasm. The activity of Arr1p is primarily regulated at the level of its export from the nucleus. Under normal conditions Arr1p is freely distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly it is localized in the cytosol due to its active export from the nucleus by Crm1p, which binds a nuclear export signal (NES) in the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (n-CRD) of Arr1p. Arr1p is activated by arsenite, which modifies the sulfhydryl groups of specific cysteines, masking the NES and abolishing its recognition by Crm1p. 	20148391
YKL185W	ASH1	ASH1 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the C4 or GATA class and has roles in mating type switching and cell cycle regulation. Its best characterized target is the HO (YDL227C) gene, which encodes an endonuclease involved in mating type switching. Repression by Ash1p is part of a complicated regulatory network that keeps HO expression tightly controlled, as expected for an endonuclease whose unregulated expression would be lethal. Ash1p binding to the HO promoter recruits the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex, which associates with Ash1p during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The resulting chromatin remodeling inhibits the binding of coactivators Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator, and this effect persists even when Ash1p is no longer bound to the promoter. Ash1p also represses transcription of the G1 cyclin CLN3, regulating the length of the G1 phase. Genetic evidence shows that Ash1p is required for filamentous growth and that it positively regulates transcription of the FLO11 gene encoding a cell surface glycoprotein. However, it has not been established whether this positive regulation is a direct effect. The ASH1 mRNA is specifically transported to daughter cells, so that Ash1p is expressed and active only in daughters.  Expression of Ash1p is also regulated at the levels of mRNA stability and translation.	15459746|16314178|21840992|19841732|22084422|19841732|22555442
YOR113W	AZF1	AZF1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Azf1p regulates different sets of genes depending on the carbon source. In the presence of glucose, Azf1p activates transcription of genes involved in growth and carbon metabolism, such as VID24, TKL2, HOR2, and SIP4, and is known to bind to the promoter regions of CLN3 and FLO11 to upregulate their transcription. During growth in nonfermentable carbon sources, Azf1p positively regulates the transcription of genes involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity, such as ECM33, GAS1, and SRL1.	9799362|11839825|16467472|23388641
YKR099W	BAS1	BAS1 encodes a transcription factor of the Myb family. Bas1p acts in concert with Pho2p to activate transcription of purine biosynthetic genes. Its regulatory targets include most genes of the AMP biosynthetic pathway, histidine and glutamine biosynthetic genes, and genes involved in one-carbon compound metabolism. Bas1p also activates serine biosynthesis under anaerobic conditions and is required for anaerobic growth. Bas1p is thought to bind to promoters first and then recruit Pho2p. The interaction between Bas1p and Pho2p is enhanced in the absence of adenine, via Pho2p sensing of the adenine pathway intermediates AICAR (5'-phosphoribosyl-5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide) and SAICAR (succinyl-AICAR). Interaction with Pho2p unmasks the Bas1p activation domain. 	22419079|19224916|19525417|19528318
YDR423C	CAD1	CAD1 encodes an AP-1 type transcription factor which contains a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), and binds to a consensus cis-acting Yap recognition element (YRE; 5'-TTAC/GTAA-3'). Cad1p is a key player in the cellular response to cadmium and other toxic compounds. The leader sequence of the CAD1 mRNA contains two upstream open reading frames (uORF) that act to block ribosomal scanning and are involved in mRNA turnover via termination-dependent decay.  The activity of Cad1p is regulated at the level of its export from the nucleus. Under normal conditions Cad1p is freely distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly it is localized in the cytosol due to its active export from the nucleus by Crm1p, which binds a nuclear export signal (NES) in the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Cad1p. Cad1p is activated by cadmium, which binds the c-CRD, abolishing the recognition of the NES by Crm1p. The only Cad1p target gene identified thus far is FRM2, a type II nitroreductase involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and the regulation of fatty acid metabolism.  Cad1p also binds the Rck1p protein kinase under conditions of oxidative stress.  	20148391
YMR280C	CAT8	CAT8 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. In the absence of glucose, Cat8p binds to carbon source response elements (CSREs) in the promoters of its target genes to activate transcription. Regulatory targets of Cat8p include genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle, such as FBP1, ICL1, and PCK1, and including the transcription factor SIP4. Cat8p is required for utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources. Along with Cat8p, the transcription factors Sip4p and Rds2p also contribute to regulation of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. All three factors bind to target sites with the same consensus sequence, although each has a preference for particular variants of the sequence, and they have overlapping regulatory roles. In the presence of glucose, CAT8 transcription is repressed by Mig1p. In the absence of glucose, CAT8 transcription is upregulated, and in addition, Cat8p is activated via phosphorylation, primarily by the Snf1p kinase. 	16959962|17052200|19686338|22964838
YJR060W	CBF1	CBF1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in the regulation of sulfur metabolism.  To promote transcription, Cbf1p forms a regulatory complex with Met4p and Met28p, recruiting Met4p, which does not bind DNA and is the sole transcriptional activator of sulfur metabolism genes, to target promoters. A subset of the Met4 regulon is strictly dependent on Cbf1p and Met28p in low-sulfur conditions. Cbf1p binds as a homodimer to an E-box site with a consensus KCACRTGA core. Recruitment of Met4p also requires a Met4 recruitment motif (RYAAT) upstream and separated from the E-box sequence by a 2-bp spacer. Cbf1p binding is not affected by the presence of the recruitment motif, but selective binding to the composite DNA binding site occurs only with the full trimeric Met4p-Met28p-Cbf1p complex. The non-DNA-binding cofactors Met4p and Met28p synergistically direct their own recruitment to specific DNA sites, discriminating between Cbf1p bound at different sites.  This is crucial because Cbf1p is also a constitutive centromere protein that binds the CDEI (8-11 bp consensus sequence Centromere DNA Element I) present in all S. cerevisiae centromeres.  A certain level of active transcription regulated by Cbf1p and Ste12p makes a direct contribution to centromere function, and is required for the production of centromeric transcripts. Ste12p and Dig1p regulate Cbf1 activity, and loss of any of these three proteins results in chromosomal instability. 	23066104|22146299|22885815
YLR098C	CHA4	CHA4 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. In the presence of serine or threonine, Cha4p activates transcription of CHA1 encoding the catabolic enzyme serine/threonine dehydratase. In addition, Cha4p is responsible for transcriptional repression of the SER3 gene, which encodes a serine biosynthetic enzyme, via an indirect mechanism.  Cha4p binds constitutively to the promoter of the SRG1 noncoding RNA gene. In the absence of serine Cha4p is inactive, but in the presence of serine it recruits the SAGA and Swi/Snf coactivator complexes to the promoter, causing nucleosomes in the area to be repositioned. The nucleosomal repositioning has the effect of repressing transcription of the neighboring SER3 gene, and has the end result of repressing serine biosynthesis.	16959962|22419079|16291644|8889513
YOR028C	CIN5	CIN5 encodes an AP-1 type transcription factor which contains a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), and binds to a consensus cis-acting Yap recognition element (YRE; 5'-TTAC/GTAA-3'). Cin5p is involved in the regulation of the osmotic stress response, and binds the promoters of dozens of genes, including those involved in the transport and catabolism of sugars and alcohol, and synthesis and accumulation of glycerol and trehalose.  Cin5p also binds the promoters of over 50 different transcription factors, including its own. Cin5p is constitutively nuclear, and is induced upon exposure to various stress conditions, including mild hyperosmotic and oxidative stress, temperature shift or metal exposure. The CIN5 promoter contains several stress-associated cis-elements, including a YRE, four stress response elements (STRE), and a heat shock element (HSE). Expression of YAP4 is regulated by an interplay between the transcription factors Yap1p and Msn2p. Cin5p is phosphorylated, a modification that is driven by PKA and GSK3, and which stabilizes the protein.  Cin5p nuclear localization is independent of its phosphorylation state, and activity is maintained in the absence of phosphorylation. 	19774548|15565582|20148391
YPR013C	CMR3	CMR3 encodes a putative transcription factor of the C2H2 zinc finger class, with two zinc fingers in a tandem array.  Cmr3p binds a 5'-YGYMRATCM-3' motif.  Cmr3p appears to regulate genes involved in transcription, metabolism, and various stress, toxin, and immune responses.	18366603
YNL027W	CRZ1	CRZ1 encodes a zinc-coordinating transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha zinc finger class that binds 5'-MWMMGCCMC-3' motifs.  Crz1p regulates transcription of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, small-molecule transport, and the synthesis of membrane lipids and ergosterol in response to stress. Activity of Crz1p is positively controlled by the highly conserved Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. Crz1p is fully phosphorylated, localized to the cytosol, and transcriptionally inactive under non-stimulating conditions. Under various stresses, such as high temperature, high osmolarity, ethanol, alkaline pH and ER stress, Ca2+ influx is stimulated, followed by dephosphorylation of Crz1p at several residues, leading to a conformational change that hides a nuclear export signal and exposes a nuclear localization signal (recognized respectively by the beta-importins Msn5p and Nmd5p). After transport of dephosphorylated Crz1p into the nucleus, the Zn-finger domain binds specific DNA sequences (termed CDREs for Crz1p-dependent response elements) present within the promoter regions of target genes. Inducible targets of Crz1p include CRZ1 itself, RCN1 and RCN2 that encode positive and negative regulators of calcineurin, CMK2 that encodes a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, PMC1, PMR1, and ENA1 that encode several P-type cation pumps responsible for efflux of Ca2+ , Mn2+ , Na+ , and Li+, and up to 100 additional genes involved in other processes.	21377728|22895050|21763361|22688810
YIL036W	CST6	CST6 encodes transcriptional activator of the ATF/CREB family, containing a bZIP structural motif which consists of a leucine zipper that mediates dimerization and an adjacent basic region that contacts DNA. Cst6p binds as a homodimer to the ATF/CREB consensus sequence TGACGTCA, and with comparable efficiency to ATF/CREB sites with single or double substitutions at positions +/- 2. Cst6p can also bind ATF/CREB sites as a heterodimer with Aca1p. Cst6p is important for a variety of biological processes including growth on nonoptimal carbon sources and resistance to a variety of drugs. Target genes include GRE2 and COS8. Cst6p-dependent activation is regulated to some extent by carbon source.	10825197|12051917
YGL166W	CUP2	CUP2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the copper fist family. In the presence of high copper levels, Cup2p activates transcription of genes involved in protection from copper toxicity, such as the metallothionein genes CUP1-1, CUP1-2, and CRS5, and the SOD1 gene encoding Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. Cup2p is constitutively nuclear, and copper binding induces a conformational change allowing Cup2p to bind DNA. Once bound to the promoter, Cup2p recruits chromatin remodeling machinery and RNA polymerase II. CUP2 has a paralog, HAA1, which encodes a transcription factor involved in the response to weak acid stress.	22387373|22609398
YPL177C	CUP9	CUP9 encodes a homeodomain-containing transcriptional repressor. Its most well-characterized target is the PTR2 gene encoding a major dipeptide and tripeptide transporter. Cup9p forms a complex with corepressors Tup1p and Cyc8p (Ssn6p) to repress PTR2 transcription. In strains of W303 background, CUP9 behaves genetically as an activator of DAL5, another transporter whose substrates include dipeptides; however, it is not known whether this effect is direct. Cup9p activity is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. When dipeptides are present, they enhance the activity of the Ubr1p and Ufd4p E3 ubiquitin ligases, which ubiquitinate Cup9p to target it for degradation. When Cup9p is degraded, PTR2 transcription is derepressed and dipeptide import is induced. Mutations in CUP9 can confer sensitivity to copper, but the mechanism is unknown.	21076411|18708352|17693598|22419079|7969120
YKR034W	DAL80	DAL80 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the C4 or GATA class. The repressors Dal80p and Gzf3p and the transcriptional activators Gat1p and Gln3p, all members of the GATA class with homologous zinc fingers, bind to the same core consensus sequence and collectively regulate the nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) pathway, which controls a set of at least 90 genes required for uptake and utilization of different nitrogen sources. Dal80p exerts its repressive effect by three different mechanisms: repression of the genes encoding the activators Gat1p and Gln3p; competition with Gat1p and Gln3p for binding at the promoters of NCR target genes; and direct repression of NCR target genes. DAL80 transcription is regulated by the NCR pathway, primarily by autoregulation and by Gln3p regulation. In addition, the four GATA factors interact with each other to form homodimers or multiple different heterodimers, allowing for fine-tuning of NCR regulation.	22419079|19380492
YIR023W	DAL81	DAL81 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Dal81p is required for transcriptional activation of many genes involved in nitrogen source utilization, always in cooperation with another transcription factor specific for a particular nitrogen source. It has regulates utilization of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA), together with Uga3p; allantoin, with Dal82p; and amino acids, with Stp1p and Stp2p. This common requirement for Dal81p in the pathways for utilization of several different nitrogen sources allows the cell to integrate the disparate nutritional signals and to induce different pathways according to availability of each source.  Although Dal81p has a putative DNA-binding domain, it is unclear whether it binds DNA in vivo, since this domain is not required for transcriptional activation with at least some of its partners (Uga3p and Dal82p). Furthermore, Dal81p has been shown to interact physically with Dal82p, so its mechanism of action may involve binding to its partner transcription factor rather than to DNA.	22419079|21515579|20581295|16959962
YNL314W	DAL82	DAL82 encodes a transcription factor that is not a member of any recognized structural class. It is smaller than most other transcription factors, and contains an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central domain required for transcriptional activation, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. In the presence of allophanate, which is the last intermediate in the allantoin degradation pathway, Dal82p activates transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in allantoin utilization, such as DAL2, DAL4, DAL5, DAL7, DUR1,2, and DUR3, and also CAR2, encoding ornithine aminotransferase involved in arginine utilization. Dal82p is one of several transcription factors involved in nitrogen source utilization (including Uga3p, Dal82p, Stp1p, and Stp2p) whose function depends on cooperation with the transcription factor Dal81p. The involvement of Dal81p in pathways for utilization of several different nitrogen sources allows the cell to integrate the disparate nutritional signals and to induce different pathways according to availability of each source. Dal82p binds to the UIS-ALL element in the promoters of target genes. Dal82p is able to bind DNA independently of Dal81p, but both Dal81p and Dal82p are required for transcriptional activation. The two transcription factors physically interact, and the DNA-binding domain of Dal81p is not necessary for transcriptional activation in cooperation with Dal82p.	22419079|2406136|1938916|8367295|10906145
YER088C	DOT6	DOT6 encodes a helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the Myb family.  Dot6p binds PAC (RNA Pol A and C) motifs of the form 5'-GCGATGAGMT-3', which are present in roughly half of all promoters of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. PAC sites function as Dot6p/Tod6p-dependent repressor elements under stress or poor nutrient conditions. Dot6p functions as a transcriptional repressor whose repressive activity is alleviated by phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) in response to glucose availability. PKA promotes ribosome biogenesis gene expression through inactivation of Dot6p. Glucose deprivation is thereby sufficient to cause repression of ribosome biogenesis. Sch9p responds to glucose availability and phosphorylates Dot6p, possibly reinforcing regulation through PKA. Dot6p appears to effect repression of ribosome biogenesis gene expression at least in part by recruitment of the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex to ribosome biogenesis gene promoters.	22964838|21468232
YLR228C	ECM22	ECM22 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Ecm22p and Upc2p, the products of paralogous genes, have similar functions. They recognize and bind to sterol regulatory elements (SRE) in the promoters of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, such as ERG1, ERG2, ERG3, ERG7, ERG25, ERG26, and ERG27, upregulating their transcription at low sterol levels. Under hypoxic conditions, both Ecm22p and Upc2p also activate transcription of the DAN/TIR genes encoding cell wall mannoproteins. Under sterol-replete conditions, Ecm22p and Upc2p localize to intracellular membranes. When sterol concentrations are low, both transcription factors relocate to the nucleus to activate ergosterol biosynthetic gene transcription. By analogy to sterol biosynthesis regulators in other organisms, it is likely that Ecm22p and Upc2p are processed during this relocation, such that the C-terminal transmembrane domain remains in the membrane while the N-terminal DNA-binding domain enters the nucleus.	19575637|18675371|16783004
YPR104C	FHL1	FHL1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the widely conserved eukaryotic forkhead family of proteins, which contain the characteristic forkhead (FH), or winged helix, DNA-binding domain. Many forkhead proteins also have a second domain referred to as the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain which binds phosphorylated threonine residues within proteins. Fhl1p has both FH and FHA domains, and binds the sequence 5'-GACGCAMA-3', which is found at over 400 locations throughout the genome.  Fhl1p is involved in regulating the expression of ribosomal protein (RP) genes by RNA polymerase II. Its FHA domain is required for interaction of Fhl1p with either Ifh1p or Crf1p. Transcription of RP genes is coordinated with that of rDNA, and is regulated in response to stress and growth conditions through a complex mechanism that involves Fhl1p, coactivator Ifh1p, corepressor Crf1p, and the TOR pathway. Fhl1p localizes to promoters of RP genes, where it can recruit either activator Ifh1p or repressor Crf1p. Both Fhl1p and Ifh1p are constitutively localized to the nucleus, but localization of Crf1p is regulated by its phosphorylation state via the TOR pathway. Fhl1p localization to RP gene promoters and RP gene expression are dependent on Rap1p and Hmo1p. Fhl1p is also loosely associated with the CURI complex, which is thought to repress transcription of ribosomal protein genes by sequestering coactivator Ifh1p. Both the CURI complex and Hmo1p, which is required for rDNA transcription by RNA polymerase I, are thought to be involved in coordinate regulation of rDNA transcription and RP gene transcription to control production of ribosomes in response to growth conditions.	11911881|15616569|19881913|15616568|11911881|15620355|16782874|16612005|15692568|17452446
YIL131C	FKH1	FKH1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the widely conserved eukaryotic forkhead family of proteins, which contain the characteristic forkhead (FH), or winged helix, DNA-binding domain. Many forkhead proteins also have a second domain referred to as the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain which binds phosphorylated threonine residues within proteins. Fkh1p has both FH and FHA domains, and is involved in regulation of expression of the CLB2 cluster of genes during the G2/M phase of the mitotic cell cycle. The CLB2 cluster of genes includes mitotic regulators such as CLB1, CLB2, CDC5 and CDC20, as well as SWI5 and ACE2, transcription factors required for the subsequent temporal wave of cell cycle regulated gene expression in the M/G1 phase interval.  Fkh1p cooperates with Isw1p to remodel chromatin and repress transcription of CLB2 during G2/M. Fkh1p associates with coding regions of active genes to regulate transcription by affecting the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II. The Fkh1p binding site 5'-GTAAACAAA-3' is present in over 1400 locations throughout the genome. FKH1 has additional roles in the establishment of chromatin silencing at the silent mating-type cassette and in the regulation of donor preference during mating type switching. FKH1 and the Swi4p/Swi6p-containing SCB-binding factor (SBF) independently regulate donor preference through direct interactions with a cis-acting sequence called the recombination enhancer, with Fkh1p binding in the G2 phase and SBF binding in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. 	21245946|11277966|16285853|16809780|9843569|17283050|12702877
YER109C	FLO8	FLO8 encodes a transcription factor that lacks overall similarity to known transcription regulator families, although it has similarity to Mss11p. Flo8p activates transcription of genes required for filamentous growth and adhesion, such as the cell wall adhesin genes FLO1, FLO10, and FLO11, and the glucoamylase gene STA1. At the FLO11 promoter, Flo8p is a player in a complicated regulatory mechanism involving noncoding RNAs: Flo8p activates transcription of the PWR1 ncRNA, which in turn interferes with transcription of the inhibitory ICR1 ncRNA, resulting in activation of FLO11 transcription. Flo8p is required for promoter binding of Mga1p, another transcription factor that regulates filamentous growth. Flo8p activity is regulated by the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Phosphorylation of Flo8p by PKA (Tpk2p) promotes Flo8p binding to FLO11 promoter.	22219507|22264825
YGL254W	FZF1	FZF1 encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor involved in the regulation of sulfite metabolism. Fzf1p contains five zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 class, three of which are positioned in tandem at the N-terminus. The fourth and fifth zinc fingers follow after interruptions of 61 and 66 amino acids, respectively. The Fzf1p binding site 5'-CTATCA-3' is present at thousands of sites throughout the genome, but the sole Fzf1p target identified thus far is SSU1, which encodes a plasma membrane sulfite pump. Fzf1p binds directly to the SSU1 promoter, and its first zinc finger region is absolutely required for DNA binding. Disruptions of Fzf1p structure can confer sulfite resistance through hyperactivation of SSU1.	8322518|8889516|10234785|10654087|10870099
YPL248C	GAL4	GAL4 encodes a transcription factor that is the archetypal member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Gal4p is required for the upregulation of genes involved in galactose utilization, including GAL1, GAL2, GAL7, GAL10, and GAL80. When galactose is present as the sole carbon source, Gal4p binds to upstream activating sequences (UASGAL) in the promoter regions of target genes and recruits the transcription machinery to actively transcribe these genes. The number of UASGAL sites in the promoters of the target genes varies, which plays a role in the extent of activation possible. Gal4p binds the UASGAL site exclusively as a homodimer, and both DNA binding and dimerization are mediated by sequences in the N-terminal region. Transcriptional activation by Gal4p relies on an acidic C-terminal region that both stimulates transcription and also binds Gal80p, an inhibitor of Gal4p activity. This acidic activating domain is a site of monoubiquitylation. Gal4p also undergoes phosphorylation during activation, although studies indicate this phosphorylation is not essential for activity. 	22084422|18779058|16670683|16959962
YFL021W	GAT1	GAT1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C4 or GATA class. The transcriptional activators Gat1p and Gln3p and the repressors Dal80p and Gzf3p, all members of the GATA class with homologous zinc fingers, bind to the same core consensus sequence and collectively regulate the nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) pathway, which controls a set of at least 90 genes required for uptake and utilization of different nitrogen sources. Gat1p is required for promoter binding of Gln3p. Because transcription of GAT1 is regulated by all four NCR regulators, including itself, it is an important component in integration of nutritional signals via the differential regulation of its regulators. Gat1p activity is also regulated: physical interaction with Gzf3p in the nucleus decreases the promoter binding of Gat1p. In addition, the four GATA factors interact with each other to form homodimers or multiple different heterodimers, allowing for fine-tuning of NCR regulation.	22419079|16487345|19380492
YLR013W	GAT3	GAT3 encodes a putative transcription factor of the GATA family. It has been shown to bind to the palindromic DNA sequence AGATCT and related sequences, but its biological role has not been established.	19111667|22189060
YIR013C	GAT4	GAT4 encodes a putative transcription factor of the GATA family. It has been shown to bind to the palindromic DNA sequence AGATCT and related sequences, but its biological role has not been established.	19111667|22189060
YEL009C	GCN4	GCN4 encodes a conserved eukaryotic basic zipper protein that functions as a global transcription factor of the general amino acid control (GAAC) network required for increased biosynthesis of translation precursors such as ribosomal proteins, amino acids and purines. The GAAC regulatory network is induced not only by amino acid starvation but also by other environmental insults such as glucose limitation, UV radiation, or high salinity stress. GCN4 targets include amino-acid biosynthesis genes and stress response factors, including components of the unfolded protein response, as well as the developmental cell-surface flocculin gene FLO11. Gcn4p activates target genes by direct binding as a homodimer to specific Gcn4-response elements (GCREs) in their promoters (consensus sequence, TGACTCA). GCN4 is regulated at the translational level by a mechanism involving a series of small regulatory upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its 5' UTR. Under normal growth conditions, GCN4 is expressed at a low basal level. Translation is activated in response to starvation for any single amino acid or a defective aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, when most mRNAs experience reduced translation.  Initiation at the GCN4 uORFs inhibits translation of the main GCN4 ORF since a strong termination signal promotes dissociation of the ribosome, and the short distance between the proximal uORF and the GCN4 ORF precludes re-initiation. Amino-acid or carbohydrate limitation both lead to reduced translation initiation, allowing the small ribosomal subunit to scan past the uORFs before associating with the large subunit and initiation factors, leading to increased translation of the main GCN4 ORF. Gcn4p is also subject to a self-controlled feedback circuit between its transcriptional activity and its stability, which depends on the Gcn4p-controlled cyclin PCL5. Increased Gcn4p transcriptional activity increases expression of PCL5, which increases degradation of Gcn4p, resulting in rapid turnover.  This buffer system to restrict transcriptional activity results in a reciprocal correlation between Gcn4p transcriptional activity and protein stability.	21115526|8139562|21111745
YPL075W	GCR1	GCR1 encodes a leucine-zipper transcriptional activator of glycolytic and ribosomal protein genes, the two largest and most abundantly transcribed classes of glucose-induced target genes in yeast. Gcr1p is a DNA-binding protein which binds the consensus sequence 5'-TGGAAGCC-3', and the ability of Gcr1p to activate transcription of most of its target genes is entirely dependent upon Rap1p binding upstream of those genes. Genes with a Rap1p binding site in their promoter tend to be Gcr1p target genes. Gcr1p homodimerization is required for the Gcr1p contribution to the activation of Rap1p target genes. Gcr1p contributes to nutrient sensing and appears to have a role in repressing the transcription of glucose-repressed genes. Gcr1p and Rap1p both exhibit perinuclear localization and activation of target genes occurs at the nuclear periphery.	22345606|16524925|1946357|10419980|8595651
YDR096W	GIS1	GIS1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Gis1p and its paralog Rph1p act as both transcriptional activators and repressors for overlapping sets of target genes. They act predominantly as repressors during exponential growth. Gis1p and Rph1p repress transcription of PHR1, and this repression is inhibited in response to DNA damage. After the diauxic shift, Gis1p and Rph1p function predominantly as transcriptional activators of genes involved in glycerol and acetate metabolism and in survival during stationary phase. Because of its roles in these processes, Gis1p is required for extension of chronological lifespan by nutrient limitation. Gis1p additionally activates transcription of some sporulation-specific genes, such as DIT1 and SPS100. Gis1p binds to postdiauxic shift (PDS) elements in the promoters of its target genes. GIS1 is a regulatory target of the Protein Kinase A (PKA), Sch9, and TORC1 pathways that sense nutrient availability. Gis1p is activated via phosphorylation by the Rim15p kinase, and is downregulated via dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A in complex with its regulatory subunit Cdc55p. Additionally, Gis1p is subject to proteasome-mediated degradation upon resumption of growth after stationary phase. In addition to its role as a transcription factor, Gis1p may function as a histone demethylase: it has JmjN and JmjC domains, which are suggestive of histone demethylase activity. However, it carries a mutation in a conserved residue of the JmjC domain and there is controversy over whether it is functional as a histone demethylase. RPH1, the paralog of GIS1, encodes a transcription factor with confirmed histone demethylase activity.	22084423|22768836|20863251|23273919|22363679|21685082
YER040W	GLN3	GLN3 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C4 or GATA class. The transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p and the repressors Dal80p and Gzf3p, all members of the GATA class with homologous zinc fingers, bind to the same core consensus sequence and collectively regulate the nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) pathway, which controls a set of at least 90 genes required for uptake and utilization of different nitrogen sources. Transcription of GLN3 is constitutive, but Gln3p activity is tightly regulated via differential localization. During growth in rich nitrogen sources, Gln3p is phosphorylated by the TOR kinases Tor1p and Tor2p, facilitating its binding to Ure2p which sequesters Gln3p in the cytosol. When only poor nitrogen sources are available, Gln3p is dephosphorylated by the Sit4p phosphatase, causing its release from Ure2p and allowing its entry into the nucleus to activate transcription. Gln3p binding to the promoters of its target genes requires Gat1p. In addition, the four GATA factors interact with each other to form homodimers or multiple different heterodimers, allowing for fine-tuning of NCR regulation.	22419079|16487345|19380492
YJL103C	GSM1	GSM1 encodes a putative transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Gsm1p has a probable role in regulation of genes involved in respiratory metabolism, since it binds to the promoters of genes involved in utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources such as ethanol and glycerol. Consistent with this possibility, transcription of GSM1 is dramatically upregulated during growth on nonfermentable carbon sources.	19686338|16959962
YJL110C	GZF3	GZF3 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the C4 or GATA class. The repressors Gzf3p and Dal80p and the transcriptional activators Gat1p and Gln3p, all members of the GATA class with homologous zinc fingers, bind to the same core consensus sequence and collectively regulate the nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) pathway, which controls a set of at least 90 genes required for uptake and utilization of different nitrogen sources. On rich nitrogen sources, Gzf3p exerts its repressive effect both by down-regulating transcription of the activator Gat1p and by binding to and sequestering Gat1p in the nucleus. The four GATA factors interact with each other to form homodimers or multiple different heterodimers, allowing for fine-tuning of NCR regulation.	22419079|19380492
YPR008W	HAA1	HAA1 encodes a transcription factor with similarity to the paralogous Cup2p, which is a member of the copper fist family. However, Haa1p is not known to bind copper or to have a role in copper metabolism. The major role of Haa1p is in regulation of genes involved in the response to acetic acid stress. In response to acetic or propionic acid, Haa1p activates transcription of genes involved in keeping acetate out of the cell or exporting it from the cell, such as YGP1, TPO2, TPO3, and HRK1. Consistent with this, Haa1p overexpression causes decreased intracellular levels of acetic acid and protects against acetic acid stress. Another target of Haa1p is SAP30, which encodes a subunit of the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex.	20955006|11504737|16176797|20955010|21586585|22961896
YFL031W	HAC1	HAC1 encodes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor of the ATF/CREB family that binds a 5'-RMCACGT-3' motif. Hac1p acts in coordination with Gcn4p to upregulate the unfolded protein response (UPR).  The expression of ~380 genes is altered during the UPR, and roughly half have Hac1p binding sequences in the promoter. Hac1p induces the transcription of genes encoding both ER chaperones and components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, that contain one or more unfolded protein response elements (UPREs) in their promoters.  UPR activation requires nonconventional splicing of the HAC1 mRNA in the cytoplasm. Unactivated HAC1 mRNA is constitutively expressed, but cannot be translated due to the presence of a 3' RNA hairpin. GTPase Ypt1p associates with and controls the RNA stability of unspliced HAC1 under normal growth conditions. Activated Ire1p cleaves the inactive HAC1 mRNA to remove the hairpin, which is then ligated by the Trl1p RNA ligase, allowing translation to proceed, and expression of Hac1p as a functional transcriptional activator. Hac1p then translocates to the nucleus and activates a large transcriptional program to compensate for the accumulation of misfolded proteins or other causes of ER stress.	22533807|23235440|22688810|19641740
YOL089C	HAL9	HAL9 encodes a putative transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. HAL9 is required for growth in the presence of high lithium cation concentrations. The direct regulatory targets of Hal9p are not known. It behaves genetically as an activator of ENA1, encoding a transporter that mediates Na+ and Li+ efflux, as an activator of the PDR5, SNQ2, and PDR16 genes involved in pleiotropic drug resistance, and as a negative regulator of the dipeptide transporter gene PTR2.	16959962|9559673|11943786|16361226
YLR256W	HAP1	HAP1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Hap1p is involved in regulating gene expression in response to levels of heme and oxygen, using its ability to bind heme as a proxy for detecting oxygen levels. In the absence of heme, during hypoxic growth, Hap1p binds to the promoters of a subset of genes, such as ROX1, SOD1, HMG1, and ERG11, and acts as a transcriptional repressor to promote anaerobic growth. In the presence of heme Hap1p binds to the promoters of a different set of genes, including CYC1, CYC7, CYT1, and CTT1, which are required for aerobic growth, and upregulates their transcription. Hap1p functions as a dimer within the larger context of a complex of chaperone proteins that includes the SSA HSP70 proteins, Hsp82p, Ydj1, and Sro9p. Hap1p binding of heme causes the complex to undergo a conformational change which allows it to act as either a repressor or an activator depending on the condition. Unlike other transcription factors in the Gal4 family, Hap1p binds to asymmetric DNA sites containing a direct repeat of two CGG triplets.
YKL109W	HAP4	HAP4 encodes an alpha helix transcription factor that provides the principal activation function of the heteromeric HAP2/3/4/5 complex which binds CCAAT boxes upstream of genes involved in respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. The Hap2/3/4/5 complex plays a central role in converting cells from fermentative to respiratory growth following the diauxic shift by inducing genes required for mitochondrial function upon glucose depletion. The HAP2/3/4/5 complex stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis in high oxygen and represses hypoxic genes. Hap2p, Hap3p, and Hap5p are constitutively expressed and together form a DNA-binding complex. Hap4p is induced upon glucose depletion, and provides the activation domain of the complex. Increased expression of Hap4 alone yields induction of genes under regulatory control of the HAP2/3/4/5 complex.	22964838
YCR065W	HCM1	HCM1 is a member of the winged helix-turn-helix/forkhead family of transcription factors, and regulates the late S-phase specific expression of genes involved in chromosome segregation, spindle dynamics, and budding. The Hcm1p consensus site is 5'-ATAAACAA-3', and Hcm1p binds upstream of genes for such proteins as microtubule binder Ase1p, kinase Cdc15p, formin Bni1p, and tropomyosin Tpm1p. Hcm1p also drives the expression of FKH1, FKH2, and NDD1, which encode M-phase specific transcription factors required for the subsequent temporal wave of cell cycle regulated transcription, and two cell cycle specific transcriptional repressors WHI5 and YHP1. The HCM1 gene is cell cycle regulated, with peak expression in G1; abundance of Hcm1p reflects a similar periodicity. The HCM1 promoter contains binding sites for late G1 transcription factor complexes MBF (Swi4p-Swi6p) and SBF (Mbp1p-Swi6p), and is subject to redundant positive regulation by both. Hcm1p is also post-translationally regulated and is an efficient substrate of Cdc28p-Clb2p.	12464632|16912276|9702192|9843569|11206552|15343339|15965243|14574415
YOR032C	HMS1	HMS1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor of the Myc family.  Hms1p binds 5'-TCACGCAA-3' sequences and positively regulates pseudohyphal growth.  Hms1p has also been implicated in the nitrogen starvation response.  Hmsp1 is involved in repression of CIT2 citrate synthase, and is required for full expression of ENO1, which encodes a glycolytic enzyme. HMS1 is repressed by UV irradiation, and activated by Mig3p, which specifically binds the HMS1 promoter.	22219507|16880382|19680226|20162531|21943358
YGL073W	HSF1	HSF1 encodes an evolutionarily conserved winged helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the E2F family that binds 5'-ATGGAACR-3' sequence motifs.  Hsf1p is involved in upregulating the transcription of heat-shock-responsive genes after robust increases in temperature. Hsf1p contains a DNA-binding domain, three leucine zipper repeats responsible for Hsf1p trimerization, a C-terminal transactivation domain, and an N-terminal transactivation domain. All Hsf1p target gene promoters contain multiples of the pentameric sequence 5'-NGAAN-3', termed heat shock elements (HSEs). Hsf1p recognizes both continuous and discontinuous repeats of HSEs.  The active DNA-binding form of Hsf1p is a homotrimer.  While each HSE is a recognition site for a single Hsf1p monomer, a minimum of three pentameric units is required for stable binding. Some target genes contain four to six contiguous HSEs that are bound by two Hsf1p homotrimers, or seven to eight units that may recruit up to three colocalized homotrimers. However, a single Hsf1p trimer is sufficient to activate transcription. Hsf1p is constitutively bound on target promoters as a homotrimer even in the absence of stress, and its activation function is modulated at the post-translational level. Hsf1p is rapidly phosphorylated after heat shock, and conversion of Hsf1p into the active form occurs simultaneously with extensive phosphorylation. Hsf1 is phosphorylated at different phosphor-acceptor sites in response to heat or menadione, suggesting stress-specific phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylation generally correlates with the transactivation of Hsf1p, though some phosphorylation events repress its transcriptional activity. Hsf1p is likely phosphorylated by one or more serine-threonine protein kinases, such as Snf1p and/or Yak1p. The Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone complex appears to repress the transcriptional activation activity of Hsf1p under nonstress conditions. During heat shock, the accumulation of unfolded or damaged proteins may titrate the chaperone machinery from Hsf1p, allowing the derepression of Hsf1p.	22817736|22688810
YDR123C	INO2	INO2 encodes a zipper-type transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family that binds 5'-GCATGTGAAT-3' motifs, known as the inositol sensitive upstream activating elements (UAS-INO) or inositol/choline responsive elements (ICRE). Ino2p and Ino4p work as a heterodimer to activate transcription by binding ICREs in the promoters of structural genes of the phosphatidyl-inositol and phosphatidyl-choline synthesis pathways, including INO1 and more than 30 other genes. INO2 contains an ICRE in its promoter, and is autoregulated in response to exogenous inositol.  This regulation involves the Opi1p repressor, which interacts with transcription activation domains in Ino2p. When inositol is limiting, Opi1p directly interacts with phosphatidic acid and is tethered to the ER membrane, derepressing the Ino2p/Ino4p activatory heterodimer, which can then turn on transcription of its target genes. When phosphatidic acid levels are reduced, Opi1p is released from the ER membrane and enters the nucleus, where it represses transcription by binding the activation domains in Ino2p.	22345606|21275641|19875326
YOL108C	INO4	INO4 encodes a zipper-type transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family that binds 5'-GCATGTGAAT-3' motifs, known as the inositol sensitive upstream activating elements (UAS-INO) or inositol/choline responsive elements (ICRE). Ino2p and Ino4p work as a heterodimer to activate transcription by binding ICREs in the promoters of structural genes of the phosphatidyl-inositol and phosphatidyl-choline synthesis pathways, including INO1 and more than 30 other genes. Regulation of the Ino2p/Ino4p heterodimer involves the Opi1p repressor, which interacts with transcription activation domains in Ino2p. When inositol is limiting, Opi1p directly interacts with phosphatidic acid and is tethered to the ER membrane, derepressing the Ino2p/Ino4p activatory heterodimer, which can then turn on transcription of its target genes. When phosphatidic acid levels are reduced, Opi1p is released from the ER membrane and enters the nucleus, where it prevents Ino2p/Ino4p from activating transcription by binding the activation domains in Ino2p.	22345606|21275641|19875326
YCL055W	KAR4	KAR4 encodes a transcription factor that lacks overall similarity to known transcription factors, but belongs to the MT-A70 subfamily of methyltransferases. Despite similarities to methyltransferases, Kar4p lacks conserved residues in the S-adenosylmethionine binding site and is unlikely to have methyltransferase activity. In small-scale experiments Kar4p has been shown to bind the promoters of its target genes and to function as a transcriptional activator. In microarray experiments KAR4 displays both positive and negative regulatory effects. Kar4p is required for karyogamy (nuclear fusion during mating), and two well-characterized targets whose transcription is activated by Kar4p in a mating pheromone-dependent manner are KAR3 and CIK1, encoding components of microtubule motors necessary for karyogamy. Other targets include genes involved in other aspects of mating, in the G1/S transition of mitosis, and in meiosis. Expression of Kar4p is regulated on multiple levels. KAR4 transcription is induced in the presence of mating pheromone and during the G1/S transition. Two forms of the protein are expressed, differing by the N-terminal 30 amino acids, and have differing stabilities.	8754797|9858604|17101777
YLR451W	LEU3	LEU3 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Leu3p both positively and negatively regulates transcription of genes involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and amino acid uptake, such as LEU1, LEU2, LEU4, ILV2, ILV5, BAP2, and others. Leu3p constitutively occupies the promoters of its target genes, binding to UASLEU sites exclusively as a homodimer. Its transcription factor activity is regulated by binding of an intermediate in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway, alpha-isopropylmalate (alpha-IPM). In the absence of alpha-IPM, Leu3p acts as a repressor. In the presence of alpha-IPM, binding of alpha-IPM to Leu3p unmasks the activation domain and allows Leu3p to function as a transcriptional activator.	22084422|16959962|12626680
YDR034C	LYS14	LYS14 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Lys14p activates transcription of genes of the lysine biosynthetic pathway, such as LYS1 and LYS9. It constitutively occupies the promoters of its target genes, but is only active when bound by the lysine biosynthetic pathway intermediate α-aminoadipate semialdehyde (alpha-AAS). The presence of lysine inhibits homocitrate synthase activity, causing a decrease in alpha-AAS levels and an apparent repression of lysine biosynthetic gene transcription because the bound Lys14p is not active. In the absence of lysine, alpha-AAS is produced and binds to Lys14p, allowing it to activate transcription.	15950477|22419079|9701810|11952910
YMR021C	MAC1	MAC1 encodes a zinc-coordinating transcription factor of the copper fist family that regulates the expression of genes involved in copper homeostasis. In response to low copper levels, Mac1p induces expression of the copper transporters Ctr1p and Ctr3p, the cell-surface metal reductases Fre1p and Fre7p, the beta-lyase IRC7 and the enolase regulate REE1. FRE1 is expressed early and FRE2 is expressed late during copper depletion. Mac1p is also responsible for the peroxide-induced transcription of catalase CTT1. Copper inhibits the activity of Mac1p. Mac1p binds a copper-response element (CuRE), 5'-TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G)-3', in the promoters of target genes. Two CuREs are required for induction by Mac1p, and the spacing between them is important. Mac1p binds single CuREs as a monomer, but binds synergistically to promoters with two or more CuREs. CuRE binding requires copper and phosphorylation of Mac1p and is disrupted by Cu(I) or Ag(I). Mac1p contains two nuclear localization signals, and is found in the nucleus under both copper-starvation and copper abundance. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain recognizes CuREs and requires two Zn(II) ions for DNA-binding activity. Mac1p also has two cysteine-rich domains referred to as Rep I and Rep II that bind a total of eight copper ions. Rep II is a copper-dependent transactivation domain. In the absence of copper, a C-terminal D helix mediates dimerization with other Mac1p molecules to form ternary activation complexes on the promoters of target genes. Nutritional copper levels stabilize Mac1p but cause an intramolecular reaction in which the D helix binds the DNA-binding domain and prevents binding to CuREs, abrogating gene activation. Mac1p is degraded at high copper concentrations. Mac1p also indirectly mediates the degradation of Ctr1p in high copper concentrations. This degradation requires the Mac1p DNA-binding domain. Becuase Mac1p is constitutively localized to the nucleus, it appears that Mac1p activates the transcription of genes required for Ctr1p degradation.	7814363|10506178|9726978|9726991|8262047|9736617|9867833|9153234|9188496|10341420|9159110|9599102|9211922|10922376|11297731|12011036
MAL63	MAL63	MAL63 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. In the presence of maltose, Mal63p positively regulates maltose fermentation by activating transcription of the MAL61 and MAL62 genes, which encode maltose permease and maltase, respectively. Mal63p binds as a dimer to three sites in the promoter region of these divergently transcribed genes. Mal63p activity is regulated by chaperone proteins. It first forms an "early complex" with Ssa1p and then transitions to an "intermediate complex" with Ssa1p, Hsp82p, and Sti1p (chaperones of the Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hop families). In the presence of maltose, transcriptionally active Mal63p is released from the intermediate complex. The cochaperone Aha1p negatively regulates Mal63p activity by inhibiting formation of the intermediate complex.	22084422|7553934|7553934|2192262|22688810|3058330|20177068
YCR039C	MATALPHA2	MATALPHA2 encodes a helix-turn-helix class transcription factor of the homeodomain family. MATalpha2p cooperates with other transcription factors to regulate the transcription of mating type-specific genes. As a heterodimer with Mcm1p, it represses transcription of mating type (MAT) a-specific genes in MAT alpha cells and in diploid cells. MATalpha2p-Mcm1p recruits the general repressor complex Tup1p-Cyc8p to promoters. The targets of MATalpha2p-Mcm1p include the a-factor genes MFA1 and MFA2, and the STE3 gene encoding the cell surface receptor for alpha-factor.  Binding to the homeodomain protein MATa1p, which on its own cannot bind DNA, alters the DNA binding specificity of MATalpha2p to repress both MAT alpha-specific genes and haploid-specific genes in diploid cells. Examples of MATa1p-MATalpha2p targets include MATalpha1, a transcriptional activator of alpha-specific genes; RME1, a transcriptional repressor of meiotic genes; and HO, encoding the site-specific nuclease required for mating type switching. Recently, it has also been shown that MATalpha2p interacts with Fyv5p and the two factors bind cooperatively to the promoters of haploid-specific genes to repress transcription in diploids. Both the MATalpha2p-Mcm1p and MATa1p-MATalpha2p complexes cause DNA bending as they bind DNA. MATalpha2p is degraded via the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway. Alone, it is short-lived, but its degradation is regulated by its binding partners: binding to Tup1p-Cyc8p or to MATa1p masks degradation signals and stabilizes MATalpha2p.	22555442|20195295|7569972|16354707|7739902
YDL056W	MBP1	Mbp1p is an Ig-fold transcription factor of the Rel subfamily.  Mbp1p is a DNA-binding protein that forms MBF complex (Mlu1 cell cycle box [MCB] Binding Factor) with Swi6p. MBF is a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates gene expression during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. MBF has over 100 putative targets, with several genes activated or repressed by MBF being involved in DNA synthesis and DNA repair (for example, CDC21, CDC8, and CDC9, and also G1 cyclins). Mbp1p can bind DNA directly without Swi6p. Swi6p does not bind DNA but acts as a trans-activator for MBF function. MBF binds DNA as a single Mbp1p/Swi6p heterodimer in an orientation-independent manner, with the most-often reported MCB consensus sequence being 5'-ACGCGT-3'. The N-terminal region of Mbp1p binds DNA, and the C-terminal region binds Swi6p. The central portion of Mbp1p contains 2 ankyrin repeats separated by a short spacer region. There is physical and genetic evidence that Mbp1p interacts with Skn7p; this complex is distinct from MBF and functions in transcription regulation. 	1986229|10512874|7917338|1608451|8372350|10747782|1608450|2005980|15965243|16285853|10447512
YMR043W	MCM1	MCM1 encodes an alpha helix transcription factor of the MADS box family. Mcm1p binds 5'-CCNNWTYRGGAA-3' motifs, and is involved in the control of various cellular processes such as argnine metabolism, M/G1 and G2/M cell-cycle-dependent transcription, recombination, TY transcription and osmotolerance. Mcm1p regulates cell-type specification by binding target sites upstream of the promoters of nine a-specific genes (MFA1, MFA2, STE2, STE6, BAR1, AGA2, DPS1, ASG7, DPS2) to activate their transcription. In alpha cells, Mcm1p combines with MATalpha1p to activate transcription of at least four alpha-specific genes (MFalpha1, MFalpha2, STE3, SAG1). Repression of a-specific genes in alpha haploid or alpha/a diploid cells involves cooperative binding of MATalpha2p and Mcm1p. In cell-cycle control, Mcm1p regulates two consecutive waves of transcription controlling G1/S and G2/M cell-cycle transitions. Transcription of four genes (CLN3, SWI4, CDC6, CDC47) peaks in late M-early G1 phase of the cell cycle via an early cell-cycle box (ECB) bound constitutively by Mcm1p. Mcm1p also controls expression of genes involved in pre-replication complex (PRC) formation, and binds cooperatively to multiple sites at autonomously replicating sequences. Transcription of 26 genes, called the CLB2 cluster, peaks in late G2/early M phase of the cell cycle and requires Mcm1p. Mcm1p is also required for the repression of arginine biosynthetic genes (ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6 and ARG8) and induction of arginine catabolic genes (CAR1 and CAR2) in response to arginine. Regulation of arginine-dependent gene expression is mediated by the multimeric ArgR/Mcm1 complex that binds upstream regulatory motifs in the promoters of arginine-sensitive promoters. The ArgR/Mcm1 complex consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p, and Mcm1p. Arg80p and Mcm1p form heterodimers and coregulate gene expression by facilitating the cooperative binding of diverse sequence-specific factors to promoters. During arginine starvation, Mcm1p positively regulates ARG1 transcription by enhancing binding of Gcn4p to the ARG1 promoter and recruiment of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. Mcm1p is phosphorylated on two major phosphorylation sites in its N-terminus. Mcm1p activity may be regulated by the SLN1 signaling pathway.	14563547|22419079
YPL038W	MET31	MET31 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha family.  Met31p recognizes binding motifs of the sequence 5'-GTGGCG-3', and serves as a dedicated adaptor for recruiting transcriptional activator Met4p, which lacks DNA-binding activity, to promoters. The expression of the majority of genes encoding enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism requires Met4p. Met32p can also serve as a Met4p adaptor. Met4p-dependent promoters have been identified in 45 genes, and each contains a Met31p/Met32p-binding site. The association of Met31p/Met32p with their binding sites in MET promoters provides a platform for recruiting and interacting with Met4p. Under sulfur-limitation, these interactions enable Met4p to activate transcription through recruitment of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase and Mediator coactivator complexes. Pools of Met31p and Met32p not associated with Met4p are degraded in a constitutive manner.	22419079
YDR253C	MET32	MET32 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha family.  Met32p recognizes binding motifs of the sequence 5'-MGCCACA-3', and serves as a dedicated adaptor for recruiting the transcriptional activator Met4p, which lacks DNA-binding activity, to promoters. The expression of the majority of genes encoding enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism requires Met4p. Met31p can also serve as a Met4p adaptor. Met4p-dependent promoters have been identified in 45 genes, and each contains a Met31p/Met32p-binding site. The association of Met31p/Met32p with their binding sites in MET promoters provides a platform for recruiting and interacting with Met4p. Under sulfur-limitation, these interactions enable Met4p to activate transcription through recruitment of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase and Mediator coactivator complexes. Pools of Met31p and Met32p not associated with Met4p are degraded in a constitutive manner.	22419079
YGR249W	MGA1	MGA1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the E2F family, with similarity to heat shock transcription factors. Mutant phenotype and genetic interaction evidence indicate that Mga1p has a role in filamentous growth. Consistent with this, Mga1p binds to the promoters of many genes involved in filamentous growth, including FLO11. Mga1p binding to promoter regions requires the presence of Flo8p. MGA1 transcription is apparently controlled by six regulators of filamentous growth (Tec1p, Ste12p, Sok2p, Phd1p, Flo8p, and Mga1p itself) that bind to the MGA1 promoter region. Mga1p activity is likely to be regulated by the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, since it interacts physically with PKA (Tpk2p) and contains two consensus PKA phosphorylation sites.	21521246|16449570|23410832|9832522
YGL035C	MIG1	MIG1 encodes a Cys2His2 zinc-finger transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha family. Mig1p is the main effector in glucose repression of SUC, MAL and GAL genes, and binds 5'-MCCCCRS-3' motifs. Like Mig2p, Mig1p represses transcription of the genes encoding enzymes for utilization of the sugars maltose, sucrose, or galactose when glucose is present. Repression can be both direct and indirect, through repression of genes encoding transcriptional activators. GAL genes are repressed directly by Mig1p, and indirectly through repression of the GAL4 gene. During repressing conditions, cytoplasmic Mig1p is dephosphorylated by the Reg1p-Glc7p protein phosphatase complex, then imported into the nucleus where it binds promoters of glucose-repressed genes and recruits the Cyc8p-Tup1p corepressor. Under glucose limitation, Mig1p is deactivated via phosphorylation by the Snf1 kinase complex at four sites (serines 222, 278, 311, 381), then exported from the nucleus by exportin Msn5p. The central amino acids 217-400 of Mig1p, containing the Snf1 phosphorylation sites, is the transport domain, with nuclear export and nuclear localization sequences.	12715202|22964838|16524925|19087243
YGL209W	MIG2	MIG2 encodes a Cys2His2 zinc-finger transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha family. Mig2p binds 5'-CCCCRSV-3' motifs. Like Mig1p, Mig2p represses transcription of genes encoding enzymes for utilization of the sugars maltose, sucrose, or galactose when glucose is present. Mig2p participates in glucose repression by targeting a subset of Mig1p-repressed genes, and responds to higher glucose concentrations than Mig1p. The MIG2 gene is induced by glucose, and is transcriptionally regulated by the Rgt2/Snf3-Rgt1 pathway. In high-glucose conditions, Mig2p is localized in the nucleus where it cooperates with Mig1p in glucose-mediated transriptional repression.  Under glucose depletion or oxidative stress, Mig2p accumulates in mitochondria and plays a role in mitochondrial fusion control. Nucleo-mitochondrial distribution of Mig2p is regulated by nutritional and oxidative stress.	22219709|19087243|22353369
YER028C	MIG3	MIG3 encodes a Cys2His2 zinc-finger transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha family. Mig3p binds 5'-CCCCRSV-3' motifs. Like Mig1p and Mig2p, Mig3p represses transcription of genes encoding enzymes for utilization of the sugars maltose, sucrose, or galactose when glucose is present.  In some strains, this contribution to glucose repression by Mig3p is marginal. In other strains, Mig3p affects the expression of hundreds of glucose-responsive genes. Mig3p is involved in the transcriptional response to DNA damage, and represses the transcription of the SIR2 histone deacetylase involved in gene silencing and the control of aging. Mig3 is under dual level control by glucose. MIG3 transcription is induced by glucose, and Mig3p is subject to Snf1-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation in the absence of glucose. MIG3 transcription is also induced by genotoxic stress, and Mig3p may function as a downstream effector in the Snf1-dependent response to hydroxyurea.	19087243|23275883|12715202
YMR070W	MOT3	MOT3 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha family, and binds 5'-HAGGYA-3' motifs. Mot3p is a globally acting, environmentally responsive regulator that modulates a variety of processes, including mating, carbon metabolism, stress response, maintenance of cell wall composition, and pheromone signaling. Mot3p forms a co-repressor complex with Rox1p that affects many cellular processes, including the repression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and of anaerobic genes, such as DAN1, during aerobic growth.  Mot3p regulates cell-wall remodeling during adaptation to anaerobic conditions. Mot3p can form a prion called [MOT3+], which naturally appears at a detectable frequency. [MOT3+] cannot carry out normal functions of Mot3p, and is likely to have far-reaching phenotypic effects, which may be advantageous under certain environmental conditions.	23379365|21397710|21717344|20071174|19345193
YOL116W	MSN1	MSN1 encodes a transcriptional activator without overall similarity to known transcription factor families. Msn1p binds DNA directly and localizes to the nucleus, and a LexA-Msn1p fusion functions as a transcriptional activator. MSN1 was discovered, and named, in several different genetic screens that reveal its various roles in filamentous growth, starch metabolism, carbon utilization, iron uptake, and stress responses. It was named MSN1 (Multicopy Suppressor of SNF) for suppression of the SUC2 (invertase) expression defect of a snf1 mutant; PHD2 (PseudoHyphal Determinant) for its ability to increase pseudohyphal growth when overexpressed; MSS10 (Multicopy Suppressor of STA10) for suppression of the glucoamylase production defect conferred by an allele of STA10 (FLO8) encoding a transcriptional activator;  and FUP1 (Ferric Utilization Proficient) for its positive regulatory effect on iron uptake. In response to heat and osmotic stress, Msn1p activates transcription of GPD1, CTT1, and HSP12; it also activates GPD1 transcription in response to methylglyoxal stress. It is one of many transcriptional activators of the FLO11 gene, which encodes a cell wall adhesin involved in filamentous growth and cell-cell interactions.	21521246|19942851|8114741|8662191|1564445|2263457|10409737|15773992
YMR037C	MSN2	MSN2 and MSN4 encode paralogous zinc finger transcription factors that regulate the general stress response. Msn2p and Msn4p regulate the expression of ~200 genes in response to several stresses, including heat shock, osmotic shock, oxidative stress, low pH, glucose starvation, sorbic acid and high ethanol concentrations, by binding to the stress response element (STRE), 5'-CCCCT-3', located in their promoters. MSN2 expression is constitutive. Msn2p and Msn4p are largely functionally redundant but there is evidence that the individual regulatory contributions of these transcription factors differ for specific genes and under particular stress conditions. In their N-terminal halves, Msn2/4p contain transcription-activating domains and a nuclear export sequence. At the C-terminus, both proteins contain a zinc-finger binding domain that recognizes the STRE element. DNA binding by Msn2p is thought to be regulated by stress and by the kinases cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA, composed of Tpk1p, Tpk2p, and Tpk3p and regulatory subunit Bcy1p) and Gsk3p. Adjacent to the zinc-finger, Msn2p and Msn4p each contain a nuclear localization signal, which is inhibited by PKA phosphorylation and activated by protein phosphatase 1 dephosphorylation. Under non-stress conditions, Msn2p and Msn4p are located in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic localization is partially regulated by TOR signalling with the 14-3-3 protein Bmh2p acting as a cytoplasmic anchoring partner for Msn2/4p. Upon stress, Msn2/4p are hyperphosphorylated, relocalized to the nucleus and then display a periodic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling behavior. Nuclear export of Msn2p is dependent on the exportin Msn5p and nuclear localization at both the import and export level is regulated by PKA. Msn2p is also positively regulated by the Psr1p/Whi2p phosphatase complex and negatively regulated by Snf1p phosphorylation and by its degradation in the nucleus, a process dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase Ssn3p.	8641288|12529445|12732613|12090248|15545648|8650168|11102521|11179418|10978547|16489456|11782433|9472026|16281053|10604478|10974099|19111667
YKL062W	MSN4	MSN2 and MSN4 encode paralogous zinc finger transcription factors that regulate the general stress response. Msn2p and Msn4p regulate the expression of ~200 genes in response to several stresses, including heat shock, osmotic shock, oxidative stress, low pH, glucose starvation, sorbic acid and high ethanol concentrations, by binding to the stress response element (STRE), 5'-CCCCT-3', located in their promoters. MSN4 gene expression is itself Msn2/4p dependent and induced by stress. Msn2p and Msn4p are largely functionally redundant but there is evidence that the individual regulatory contributions of these transcription factors differ for specific genes and under particular stress conditions. In their N-terminal halves, Msn2/4p contain transcription-activating domains and a nuclear export sequence.

YMR164C	MSS11	MSS11 encodes a transcription factor that lacks overall similarity to known transcription regulator families, although it has similarity to Flo8p. Mss11p activates transcription of genes required for filamentous growth and adhesion. It is one of many regulators of FLO11, but seems to play a central role as it is absolutely required for FLO11 transcription. Other targets of Mss11p activation include the flocculin gene FLO1; the STA2 gene encoding a glucoamylase required for starch degradation; and cell wall mannoprotein genes such as TIR2, TIR3, and TIR4.	21521246|18001350|12492858|22384390|15466424
YHR124W	NDT80	NDT80 encodes a transcriptional activator that is the founding member of the NDT80/phoG subfamily of the Ig-fold class of transcription factors. Ndt80p activates transcription of genes required for multiple aspects of meiosis and sporulation, beginning mid-way through the sporulation process, and is central to establishing the commitment to meiosis. Ndt80p binds to a subset of middle sporulation elements, MSEs, that are also recognized by the meiotic transcriptional repressor Sum1p; binding of Ndt80p and Sum1p is mutually exclusive. As a key regulator of meiosis, NDT80 is regulated at multiple levels. NDT80 transcription is repressed by Sum1p and Ume6p, and activated by Ndt80p in a positive feedback loop. Ndt80p is extensively phosphorylated when active and is thought to be a substrate of the meiotic-specific kinase Ime2p. Genetic evidence suggests that the nuclear localization of Ndt80p is regulated by the pachytene checkpoint.	22390969|22084423|21471004|15161958
YPR052C	NHP6A	NHP6A and NHP6B encode paralogous High Mobility Group (HMG) B domain-containing transcription factors that are involved in the modulation of chromatin structure.  The Nhp6A and Nhp6B proteins differ at their N-termini, but over the 90 amino acid core region are 96% similar. Nhp6p contains a single HMGB domain that binds DNA in the minor groove and a basic N-terminal extension that wraps around DNA to contact the major groove, enabling Nhp6p to bind DNA as a monomer in a sequence-nonspecific manner, and bend DNA sharply. Nhp6p affects a range of processes linked to appropriate regulation of transcription through maintenance of normal chromatin structure. Nhp6p functions in the formation of preinitiation complexes at RNA polymerase II promoters, and also promotes RNA polymerase III transcription, as well as facilitating the activity of chromatin modifying complexes. Nhp6p localization in the vicinity of transcription start sites parallels that of nucleosomes. Expression of NHP6 genes is regulated by the concentration of Nhp6 protein or RNA, as overexpression of Nhp6p results in a dramatic decrease in NHP6 expression, and is toxic to cells.	20123079
YBR089C-A	NHP6B	NHP6A and NHP6B encode paralogous High Mobility Group (HMG) B domain-containing transcription factors that are involved in the modulation of chromatin structure.

YDR043C	NRG1	NRG1 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Nrg1p, along with its paralog Nrg2p, responds to glucose signals received via Snf1p kinase, and to stress signals received via the Rim101p transcriptional repressor. Nrg1p and Nrg2p regulate a variety of processes, including response to glucose levels; response to alkaline pH and to salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress; filamentous growth; and biofilm formation. Some major targets of Nrg1p and Nrg2p include FLO11, encoding a cell surface adhesin, ENA1, encoding a plasma membrane salt efflux pump, and SUC2, encoding extracellular invertase. The set of genes regulated by Nrg1p overlaps with, but is not identical to, the set regulated by Nrg2p. Some targets repressed by Nrg1p but apparently not by Nrg2p include RSB1, encoding a lipid translocase that regulates plasma membrane lipid composition, and DIT1, encoding an enzyme required for spore wall maturation. Nrg1p represses transcription by recruiting the Cyc8p-Tup1p complex to promoters. NRG1 expression and Nrg1p activity are regulated on multiple levels. NRG1 transcription is glucose-repressed and is up-regulated at acidic pH, in contrast to NRG2 transcription which does not respond to glucose levels and is up-regulated at alkaline pH. Stability of the NRG1 mRNA is negatively regulated via mRNA decay, and activity of Nrg1p is regulated via phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 in response to salt, osmotic, and other stresses.	22219507|18287536|16024810|16524925|22595243|16278455|16607517|15075261|18806212

NRG2 transcription does not respond to glucose levels and is up-regulated at alkaline pH, in contrast to NRG1 transcription which is glucose-repressed and up-regulated at acidic pH. Stability of the NRG2 mRNA is negatively regulated via mRNA decay.	22219507|16524925|22595243|16278455|15075261
YAL051W	OAF1	OAF1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Acting primarily as a heterodimer with its paralog Pip2p, Oaf1p binds to oleate response elements in the promoters of genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation and peroxisome biogenesis, such as POX1, POT1, and CTA1. The heterodimer binds constitutively to promoters, and is activated by binding of oleate to Oaf1p. The Oaf1p-Pip2p heterodimer also activates PIP2 transcription. Independently of Pip2p, Oaf1p binds to subtelomeric regions and may promote silencing in response to fatty acids. Although OAF1 transcription is constitutive, Oaf1p activity is regulated: in addition to being activated by oleate, Oaf1p is activated by phosphorylation under inducing conditions.	19686338|21206489|16959962|16949166|10428786
YDR081C	PDC2	PDC2 encodes a transcriptional activator without overall similarity to known transcription factor families. Pdc2p is essential for transcriptional activation of genes involved in thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP; also known as ThDP) biosynthesis, such as PHO3, THI4, and THI20, in response to thiamin deprivation. Pdc2p also activates transcription of the PDC1 and PDC5 genes, encoding pyruvate decarboxylases involved in alcoholic fermentation. Pdc2p can bind independently to target promoters, but many of its thiamin biosynthetic gene targets are shared with those of the transcription factor Thi2p, and binding of Pdc2p to promoters is enhanced in the presence of Pdc2p and another regulatory protein, Thi3p, that binds both Pdc2p and Thi2p. In the absence of thiamin, Thi3p interaction with Pdc2p and Thi2p allows them to activate transcription, possibly by a conformational change that unmasks their activation domains. In the presence of TPP (i.e., under thiamin-replete conditions), Thi3p binding to TPP releases it from Pdc2p and Thi2p, de-activating them. Pdc2p activates transcription of PDC5 independently of Thi2p and Thi3p, but in a thiamine-dependent manner. In contrast, Pdc2p activates transcription of PDC1 constitutively.	8264540|22404710|19013460|16850348
YGL013C	PDR1	PDR1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Pdr1p activates transcription of genes involved in pleiotropic drug resistance, such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter genes PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1, whose products mediate drug efflux from the cell. Pdr1p targets also have roles in hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) tolerance, ethanol tolerance, the salt stress response, and sphingolipid biosynthesis. Pdr1p binds to multiple PDREs (pleiotropic drug resistance elements) in the promoters of target genes, either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other transcription factors, including Pdr3p and Stb5p. PDR3, a paralog of PDR1, is also a target of Pdr1p regulation. Pdr1p is phosphorylated, although the regulatory significance of this is unknown.	22084422|17052200|16959962|7629054|21763361|16406363
YBL005W	PDR3	PDR3 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Pdr3p activates transcription of genes involved in pleiotropic drug resistance, such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter genes PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1, whose products mediate drug efflux from the cell. Pdr3p targets also have roles in hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) tolerance, ethanol tolerance, the salt stress response, and sphingolipid biosynthesis. Pdr3p binds to multiple PDREs (pleiotropic drug resistance elements) in the promoters of target genes, either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with its paralog Pdr1p. Regulatory targets of the Pdr3p homodimer include genes involved in retrograde signaling and the DNA damage response. PDR3 transcription is regulated by Pdr1p and is also positively autoregulated.	22084422|17052200|16959962|7629054|21763361|16406363
YLR266C	PDR8	PDR8 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Pdr8p has similarity to other transcription factors with roles in drug resistance, including its paralog Yrr1p. Some targets of Pdr8p promoter binding and transcriptional activation include the AZR1, YOR1, and QDR2 genes encoding drug transporters, and also CTT1, GTT2, and YLL056C which are known or suspected to have roles in drug resistance. PDR8 is required for growth on the nonfermentable carbon sources glycerol and lactate, and for normal cell wall structure (as detected by resistance to Calcofluor White). Overproduction confers resistance to ketoconazole and oligomycin.	9290251|11353088|12529331|12529331
YKL043W	PHD1	PHD1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the KilA-N family. Phd1p binds to the promoters of many genes involved in filamentous growth, including FLO11, and genetic evidence indicates that it acts primarily as an activator. Phd1p interacts with the Tup1p-Cyc8p general transcriptional repressor complex, and may recruit Tup1p-Cyc8p to certain sites. PHD1 transcription is apparently controlled by six regulators of filamentous growth (Tec1p, Ste12p, Sok2p, Mga1p, Flo8p, and Phd1p itself) that bind to the PHD1 promoter region. Phd1p activity is regulated by the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, and the Yak1p protein kinase is a central player in this regulation.	21521246|21552514|16449570|21149646
YDL106C	PHO2	PHO2 encodes a helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the homeodomain family that recognizes the binding motif '5-WTAWTA-3'. Pho2p activates genes involved in several different processes including purine nucleotide biosynthesis (ADE1, ADE2, ADE8 and ADE5,7), histidine biosynthesis (HIS4), tryptophan biosynthesis (TRP4), and phosphate utilization (PHO5, PHO81). Pho2p activates transcription along with one of at least three distinct partner proteins: the zinc finger protein Swi5p, the basic-helix-loop-helix factor Pho4p, and Bas1p, a myb-like activator. Pho2p and Pho4p cooperatively bind to the promoter site of the PHO5 acid phosphatase, and are required for PHO5 expression when cells are starved of phosphate. Pho2p and Swi5p together activate HO, while Pho2p and Bas1p activate genes in the purine and histidine biosynthesis pathways. Pho2p is phosphorylated by cdc2/CDC28-type kinase at the 'SPIK' site (amino acids 230-233), which facilitates its interaction with Pho4p and is required for PHO5 expression under low phosphate conditions.	3049251|8918192|19111667|1495962|7902583|12145299|10884387|2664469
YFR034C	PHO4	PHO4 encodes a zipper-type transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. Pho4p binds as a homodimer to DNA containing the binding site 5'-SCACGTGS-3', which is found in the promoters of genes that are positively regulated in response to phosphate availability. Multiple phosphorylation sites on Pho4p play distinct roles in regulating its subcellular localization and its DNA binding function. The Pho80p-Pho85p kinase complex phosphorylates Pho4p on five Ser-Pro (SP) dipeptides referred to as SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 and SP6. Sites SP2 and SP3 regulate the nuclear export of Pho4p, while site SP4 regulates the import of Pho4p. Site SP6 regulates the interaction of Pho4p with Pho2p, which is required for expression of acid phosphatase PHO5. When phosphate is abundant, Pho4p is phosphorylated by the Pho80p-Pho85p complex and exported to the cytoplasm by the receptor Msn5p where it is unable to activate transcription of phosphate-responsive genes such PHO5. When phosphate is limiting, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Pho81p inactivates the Pho80p-Pho85p complex, leading to accumulation of unphosphorylated Pho4p in the nucleus and subsequent activation of phosphate-responsive genes.	2220078|9443961|2183025|10320381|10320381|9853758|8108735
YOR363C	PIP2	PIP2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Acting primarily as a heterodimer with its paralog Oaf1p, Pip2p activates transcription of genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation and peroxisome biogenesis, such as POX1, POT1, and CTA1. The heterodimer binds constitutively to oleate response promoter elements, and is activated by binding of oleate to Oaf1p. The Oaf1p-Pip2p heterodimer also activates PIP2 transcription. 	19686338|16949166|16959962|10428786
YLR014C	PPR1	PPR1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Ppr1p activates transcription of genes of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway such as URA1, URA3, URA4, and URA10, binding as a homodimer to the promoter regions of its target genes. Its activity is stimulated by the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway early intermediates orotic acid (OA) and dihydro-orotate (DHO). PPR1 is a target of post-transcriptional regulation via deadenylation-independent degradation of its mRNA.	22419079|16959962|9858611|12799443
YKL015W	PUT3	PUT3 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. In the presence of proline and in the absence of better sources of nitrogen, Put3p positively regulates transcription of genes involved in proline utilization, principally PUT1 and PUT2. Put3p constitutively occupies the promoters of its target genes, binding to UASPUT sites exclusively as a homodimer. Its transcription factor activity is regulated by binding of proline, which causes a conformational change that unmasks the transcriptional activation domain. Put3p is also activated by phosphorylation and is differentially phosphorylated in response to different nitrogen sources.	22084422|17052200|16959962|15950477
YPR186C	PZF1	PZF1 encodes an RNA polymerase III transcription factor, TFIIIA, that is specific for the 5S rRNA genes. Pzf1p binds to the Internal Control Region (ICR) of 5S rRNA genes and mediates promoter recognition by RNA polymerase III. Pzf1p bound to DNA first recruits TFIIIC, a six-subunit complex. The TFIIIA-TFIIIC-DNA complex then recruits TFIIIB, a three-subunit complex, and finally RNA polymerase III. Pzf1p has nine Cys2His2 zinc fingers, some of which bind DNA and some of which contribute to interaction with TFIIIC.	11419933|17626045|9891026
YNL216W	RAP1	RAP1 encodes a highly conserved helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the MYB superfamily. Rap1p binds sequences of the form 5'-CACCCATACA-3', and controls telomere function, silencing, and the activation of glycolytic and ribosomal protein genes. Rap1p is the major double-stranded telomeric repeat-binding protein in budding yeast and has essential roles in telomere length regulation, subtelomeric gene silencing and chromosome end protection. Rap1p is the only telomere protein that is conserved from budding and fission yeast to mammals. Rap1p and coactivator Gcr1p constitute a complex to recognize the core elements of the upstream activation sequences (UAS) of glycolytic enzyme genes. Rap1p mediates silencing at the mating loci and telomeres by recruiting Sir3p and Sir4p to chromatin.  Rap1p further regulates telomere function through recruitment and binding of the telomere length regulators Rif1p and Rif2p to form the telomeric dsDNA end-protection complex. Rap1p exhibits perinuclear localization and activation of target genes occurs at the nuclear periphery.	21187076|21217703|23299958
YOR380W	RDR1	RDR1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Rdr1p represses transcription of genes involved in pleiotropic drug resistance, including the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene PDR5. Rdr1p-mediated repression requires PDREs (pleiotropic drug resistance elements) in the promoters of target genes; however, it is unknown whether Rdr1p binds these sequences directly.	16959962|16406363|11882665
YPL133C	RDS2	RDS2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle.  After a shift from glucose to ethanol or glycerol carbon source, Rds2p binds to carbon source response elements (CSREs) in the promoters of its target genes. Rds2p activates transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, the TCA cycle, and respiration, and its targets also include some genes involved in resistance to stress and drugs. While Rds2p is primarily a positive regulator, it has been found to negatively regulate the expression of some genes encoding negative regulators of gluconeogenesis, such as PFK27 and GID8. Along with Rds2p, the transcription factors Cat8p and Sip4p also contribute to regulation of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. All three factors bind to target sites with the same consensus sequence, although each has a preference for particular variants of the sequence, and they have overlapping regulatory roles. The set of target genes regulated by Rds2p also overlaps with the set of genes regulated by Adr1p. Under inducing conditions, Rds2p is phosphorylated, primarily by the Snf1p kinase. Its phosphorylation is crucial for full activity at some promoters (for example, PKC1), but not others (for example, FBP1). 	16959962|17875938|18683633|19686338|22687600
YBR049C	REB1	REB1 encodes an essential myb-family transcription factor initially implicated in the regulation of ribosomal RNA transcription. The Reb1p consensus binding site (5'-CGGGTRR-3'), however, is also found in the promoters of a large number of genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase II, as well as in centromeres and in subtelomeric regions. Further studies have suggested that Reb1p may indeed function as a weak transcriptional activator of a variety of protein-coding genes throughout the genome, including ACT1, FAS1 and FAS2, CLN2. Multiple Reb1p binding sites are located within the subtelomeric regions, where they appear to act as anti-silencing barriers that prevent the spreading of silenced chromatin. More recently, Reb1p has been identified as one of several factors, including Abf1p, Rsc3p, Rap1p, Mcm1p, Tbf1p and Cep3p, whose binding to the promoter region prevents nucleosome formation in the vicinity, thus generating a nucleosome-free region around the promoter and facilitating the process of transcription initiation.	2656694|7925441|7975895|10228166|19410542|21596311
YLR176C	RFX1	RFX1 encodes a winged helix-turn-helix transcription factor that binds a consensus sequence termed the X box (5'-GTTRCYATG-3'). Multiple X box-related sequences of different strength are in the promoters of the four ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase genes (RNR1-4). Rfx1p recruits the Tup1p-Ssn6p general repressor complex to suppress the transcription of RNR genes. Upon DNA damage or other replication blocks, activation of the Mec1-Rad53-Dun1 kinase cascade results in phosphorylation of Rfx1p, which abolishes its binding ability, leading to the transcriptional induction of the RNR genes. The transcription of RFX1 is negatively auto-regulated and positively regulated by Crt10p. The expression of RFX1 is low under normal growth conditions, but inducible by DNA-damaging agents. The RFX1 promoter consists of one weak-affinity X box, and one of strong affinity, and RFX1 exhibits 5' untranslated region (UTR) heterogeneity due to alternative transcription start site selection.  The long variant of RFX1 contains multiple upstream open reading frames (uORFs) which reduce translation of the main ORF under normal growth conditions. Weak induction of RFX1 may occur immediately following DNA damage, providing a buffer against spurious transcriptional activation of the pathway. It has been speculated that delaying full activation ensures a rapid restoration of the basal repressed state when DNA damage is repaired, which may serve as an autonomous regulatory circuit. Ccr4p influences Rfx1p abundance by controlling RFX1 mRNA stability.	18616603|23105001
YMR182C	RGM1	RGM1 encodes a putative transcription factor that contains two C2H2 zinc fingers. Its targets have not been characterized in small-scale studies. Overproduction of Rgm1p inhibits growth and stimulates expression of genes involved in aldehyde metabolism and monosaccharide catabolism. Rgm1p has been observed to bind to subtelomeric elements, and under hypoxic conditions, it relocalizes quickly from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. RGM1 has a paralog, USV1, that encodes a transcription factor involved in respiratory metabolism and the stress response.	22932476|21206489|9171100|1923755|16880382
YKL038W	RGT1	RGT1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle.  Rgt1p has a role in regulation of glucose uptake. In the absence of glucose, Rgt1p binds to multiple consensus sites upstream of the promoters of its target genes to repress their transcription by recruiting the general repressors Cyc8p and Tup1p.  The major targets of Rtg1p repression include the hexose transporter genes (HXT1-7) and the hexokinase gene HXK2. Rtg1p acts in concert with two paralogous corepressors, Mth1p and Std1p, which bind to it. In the presence of glucose, Mth1p and Std1p are phosphorylated by the protein kinase Yck1p, signaling their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. When Mth1p and Std1p are removed, Rgt1p is a target for phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Phosphorylated Rgt1p is unable to bind DNA and therefore unable to repress transcription. Under high glucose conditions, Rgt1p is hyperphosphorylated, which converts it into a transcriptional activator; it is required under these conditions for full expression of HXT1.	22964838|22219709|22084422|17052200|16524925|15667318
YHL027W	RIM101	RIM101 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Two of the major targets of Rim101p repression are NRG1 and NRG2, encoding transcriptional repressors. Rim101p regulates a variety of processes, either directly or indirectly via repression of NRG1 and NRG2: response to alkaline pH, weak acid stress, and anaerobic conditions; filamentous growth; meiosis and sporulation; septum assembly; response to altered lipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane bilayer; and cell wall assembly. Rim101p represses transcription by recruiting the Cyc8p-Tup1p complex to promoters. Rim101p activity is regulated by proteolysis. In acidic conditions, Rim101p exists as a full-length, inactive form. At high pH, the C-terminal tail is removed by Rim13p protease, activating Rim101p as a transcriptional repressor. Nuclear localization of Rim101p is also regulated, via phosphorylation. This regulation is dependent on Pho85p kinase but it is not known whether Rim101p is a direct target of Pho85p in vivo.	22360598|19220866|18287536|19633265|20382759|20402793|16524906|16024810|12509465
YPL089C	RLM1	RLM1 encodes a transcription factor of the MADS family that is primarily involved in the cell wall integrity pathway. Like other MADS family members, Rlm1p bends DNA as it binds; however, the extent of bending is less than is seen for some other family members. Rlm1p is constitutively located in the nucleus. It is phosphorylated by the Slt2p kinase upon cell wall stress, and phosphorylated Rlm1p activates transcription of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and maintenance. Rlm1p is also involved in transcription of genes required for tolerance of low pH stress. Under conditions of high osmolarity, Rlm1p is stimulated by the HOG pathway to activate transcription of Slt2p, creating a positive feedback loop. RLM1 has a paralog, SMP1, that encodes a transcription factor involved in osmotic stress response. 	10064699|9121433|22174182|19717745|14563547|22702539|12410835|10594829
YGR044C	RME1	RME1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. In haploid cells, Rme1p prevents the initiation of meiosis by negatively regulating IME1, encoding a master activator of meiosis. Rme1p also promotes mitosis, by positive regulation of the G1 cyclin gene CLN2. In addition, Rme1p has a major role in promoting filamentous growth via activation of transcription of FLO11, encoding a cell surface adhesin. Rme1p binds to Rme1 Response Elements, RREs, in the promoters of its target genes. Rme1p was thought to function as both a transcriptional activator, usually when bound close to its target promoter, and as a transcriptional repressor, when bound at a distance from its target gene. However, recent evidence suggests that Rme1p is always a transcriptional activator. Repression of IME1 transcription is accomplished by activation of transcription of a long noncoding RNA, IRT1, that overlaps the IME1 gene. Transcription of IRT1 recruits histone deacetylases to the IME1 gene and induces the formation of repressive chromatin across the region. By analogy, the repressive action of Rme1p at sites distant from the repressed target is now suggested to be caused by activation of noncoding transcription and subsequent chromatin repression. In diploids, transcription of RME1 is repressed by MATa1p-MATalpha2p repressor, causing the IRT1 ncRNA not to be transcribed and thereby allowing IME1 to be transcribed and meiosis to occur.	20842291|22959267|14668363|8846775
YPR065W	ROX1	ROX1 encodes an alpha helix transcription factor of the high mobility group (HMG) family.  Rox1p binds 5'-YYHATTGTTCTC-3' motifs in the promoters of diverse hypoxic genes and prevents their expression in aerobic conditions. Mot3p enhances this aerobic repression by helping Rox1p recruit the Ssn6p/Tup1p general co-repressor complex and by stabilizing the Rox1p-Ssn6p interaction. Rox1p is important for growth and modulation of ergosterol levels in response to high osmolarity. Rox1p binds telomeric X elements and controls the propagation of telomeric silencing toward centromeres in response to stress and metabolic changes. ROX1 transcription is regulated by Hap1p.  When oxygen levels drop, Hap1p is inactivated and ROX1 is not expressed, allowing aerobic expression of genes involved in the hypoxic response.	23007444|22928082|21206489|21299653
YER169W	RPH1	RPH1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Rph1p and its paralog Gis1p act as both transcriptional activators and repressors for overlapping sets of target genes. They act predominantly as repressors during exponential growth. Rph1p and Gis1p repress transcription of PHR1, and this repression is inhibited in response to DNA damage. After the diauxic shift, Rph1p and Gis1p function predominantly as transcriptional activators of genes involved in glycerol and acetate metabolism and in survival during stationary phase. Rph1p binds to stress response elements (STREs) in the promoters of its target genes. In addition to its role as a transcription factor, Rph1p also functions as a histone demethylase, acting on residue K36 of histone H3 during transcription elongation. Rph1p carries the JmjN and JmjC domains characteristic of histone demethylases. GIS1, the paralog of RPH1, encodes a transcription factor whose histone demethylase activity is not confirmed.	22363679|21684259|11809875
YDL020C	RPN4	RPN4 encodes a zinc-coordinating proteasomal transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha zinc finger family. Rpn4p contains a C2H2-type finger motif and two acidic domains. Rpn4p mediates expression of a majority of proteasome genes by binding proteasome-associated control elements (PACE; 5'-GGTGGCAAA-3') found in their promoters, and also in a number of promoters of genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.  Targets include PRE1, PRE3, PRE6, PRE7, PRE10, PUP3, RPN9, RPN12, ECM29, RPT2, RPT3, RPT4, SHP1, and OTU1. Rpn4p is also required for regulation of genes involved in DNA repair and other cellular processes, such as DNA damage-inducible genes MAG1 and DDI1. Upon oxidative stress, RPN4 transcripion is upregulated by Yap1p.  The RPN4 promoter also has binding sites for other transcription factors, incuding Pdr1p/Pdr3p and Hsf1p. Rpn4p is a feedback regulator of YAP1 and PDR1, and plays a vital role in cellular tolerance to various stresses. Rpn4p is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, revealing a transcriptional feedback loop formulated to ensure proteasome activity.	22350895|10350051|21543789|21380517
YJR127C	RSF2	RFS2 encodes a putative transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Rsf2p was shown to bind DNA in a large-scale study. The rsf2 null mutant has a mild growth defect on glycerol and lactate media, and microarray experiments show that the transcription of about 100 genes is affected both positively and negatively. The null mutant displays reduced transcription of some genes involved in respiratory growth, such as GUT1 and GUT2, respectively encoding glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; COX4, encoding a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase; MRP13, encoding a mitochondrial ribosomal subunit; and RPO41, encoding mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Overexpression of Rsf2p increases levels of the ALD6 mRNA.	12584194|16208474|19111667
YOL067C	RTG1	RTG1 and RTG3 encode positive regulators of the retrograde (RTG) regulatory pathway, which responds to mitochondrial dysfunction and to growth on nitrogen sources requiring alpha-ketoglutarate for nitrogen assimilation.  The RTG pathway provides for ammonium assimilation from poor nitrogen sources and a source of glutamate in the absence of mitochrondrial function. Rtg1p and Rtg3p form a heterodimeric transcriptional activator whose nuclear localization is regulated in response to mitochrondrial integrity and nitrogen availability. When nitrogen is available and mitochrondria are functional, Rtg1p/Rtg3p resides in the cytoplasm. Reduction in mitochrondrial function or depletion of nitrogen results in nuclear localization of Rtg1p/Rtg3p and subsequent activation of target genes. Regulation of the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Rtg1p/Rtg3p involves Mks1p, Rtg2p, and Bmh1p/Bmh2p. When phosphorylated, Mks1p forms an anchor complex with Bmh1p/Bmh2p that keeps Rtg1p/Rtg3p in the cytoplasm. Rtg2p regulates the subcellular location of the Rtg1p/Rtg3p heterodimer, and can relieve its cytoplasmic sequestration by competing for Bmh1p/Bmh2p binding to Mks1p.	22964838
YBL103C	RTG3	RTG1 and RTG3 encode positive regulators of the retrograde (RTG) regulatory pathway, which responds to mitochondrial dysfunction and to growth on nitrogen sources requiring alpha-ketoglutarate for nitrogen assimilation.  The RTG pathway provides for ammonium assimilation from poor nitrogen sources and a source of glutamate in the absence of mitochrondrial function. Rtg1p and Rtg3p form a heterodimeric transcriptional activator whose nuclear localization is regulated in response to mitochrondrial integrity and nitrogen availability. When nitrogen is available and mitochrondria are functional, Rtg1p/Rtg3p resides in the cytoplasm. Reduction in mitochrondrial function or depletion of nitrogen results in nuclear localization of Rtg1p/Rtg3p and subsequent activation of target genes. Regulation of the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Rtg1p/Rtg3p involves Mks1p, Rtg2p, and Bmh1p/Bmh2p. When phosphorylated, Mks1p forms an anchor complex with Bmh1p/Bmh2p that keeps Rtg1p/Rtg3p in the cytoplasm. Rtg2p regulates the subcellular location of the Rtg1p/Rtg3p heterodimer, and can relieve its cytoplasmic sequestration by competing for Bmh1p/Bmh2p binding to Mks1p.	22964838
YOR140W	SFL1	SFL1 encodes a winged helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the E2F family.  Sfl1p binds sequences of the form 5'-ATAGAAGAA-3' and represses flocculation-related genes, and is required for normal cell-surface assembly during vegetative growth. Sfl1p negatively regulates FLO11 through interference by transcription of the overlapping noncoding RNA ICR1, for which Sfl1p is required. FLO11 is in a transcriptionally permissive state when ICR1 is repressed by the transcription factor Flo8p. Competition between Flo8p and Sfl1p for binding to the FLO11 promoter determines whether ICR1 is transcribed, which keeps FLO11 silenced, or repressed, which allows FLO11 transcription. FLO10 is also regulated by Sfl1p and Flo8p, via a mechanism that involves cis-interfering ncRNAs encoded upstream of FLO10 that likely control gene expression through promoter occlusion. Sfl1p is present at the promoters of Cyc8p-Tup1p-repressible genes, and appears to recruit the general corepressor Cyc8p-Tup1p that inhibits the transcription of many diversely regulated genes. Sfl1p may also interact with Srb/mediator proteins to inhibit transcription by the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Phosphorylation of Sfl1p by protein kinase A prohibits dimerization and DNA-binding by Sfl1p.	11399075|22332975|21521246|9755175
YLR403W	SFP1	SFP1 encodes a zinc-coordinating transcription factor of the beta-beta-alpha zinc finger family. Sfp1p regulates the expression of nearly 10% of yeast genes, including those involved in ribosome biogenesis and the regulation of cell size, and can form the amyloid-based [ISP+] prion. Sfp1p activity is regulated by localization to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of ribosome biogenesis and ribosomal protein genes, likely by controlling the localization of the transcription factors Fhl1p and Ifh1p. Under nutrient limitation or chemical stress, Sfp1p is retained in the cytoplasm by Mrs6p, a component of the secretory pathway. Sfp1p is directly phosphorylated at multiple residues by TORC1, with crosstalk to the PKA pathway. Sfp1p negatively regulates TORC1 phosphorylation of Sch9p, the other key target of TOR in the control of ribosome biogenesis, revealing a negative feedback mechanism that regulates ribosomal protein and ribosome biogenesis gene transcription. Sfp1p remains cytoplasmic when Tor1p is inhibited by rapamycin. In [ISP+] strains, Sfp1p forms aggregates in the nucleus.	23498901|22094417|22482457|22575477|21821114
YJL089W	SIP4	SIP4 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. In the absence of glucose, Sip4p binds to carbon source response elements (CSREs) in the promoters of its target genes to activate transcription. Regulatory targets of Sip4p include genes involved in gluconeogenesis, such as FBP1, ICL1, and PCK1. Along with Sip4p, the transcription factors Cat8p and Rds2p also contribute to regulation of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. All three factors bind to target sites with the same consensus sequence, although each has a preference for particular variants of the sequence, and they have overlapping regulatory roles. Cat8p may have a more important role than Sip4p, since SIP4 is itself regulated by Cat8p and since the sip4 null mutant does not display defects in utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources. In the absence of glucose, SIP4 transcription is upregulated, and in addition, Sip4p is activated via phosphorylation, primarily by the Snf1p kinase. 	16959962|19686338|17052200
YHR206W	SKN7	SKN7 encodes a highly-conserved kinase-regulated stress-responsive transcription factor that modulates the response to oxidative insults and cell wall stress. Skn7p consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain similar to that of the heat shock transcription factor (Hsf1p) and a C-terminal receiver domain which confers regulation of Skn7p transcriptional activity by His-Asp phosphorelay signaling via phosphorylation of a conserved aspartate. Both the DNA-binding domain and the receiver domain are essential for the role of Skn7p in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis, the cell cycle, and the response to osmotic shock and to oxidative stress. Skn7p activates transcription of many of the key oxidative stress response genes, including TRR1, TRX2, TSA1, GPX2, AHP1, CCP1, and CTT1. Skn7p also upregulates heat shock proteins by binding to heat shock elements (HSEs) in H2O2-treated cells exposed to heat shock.	22737670|21131436
YNL167C	SKO1	SKO1 encodes a transcriptional repressor of the ATF/CREB family, containing a bZIP structural motif which consists of a leucine zipper that mediates dimerization and an adjacent basic region that contacts DNA.  Sko1p binds as a homodimer the ATF/CREB consensus sequence TGACGTCA, and represses transcription both by recruiting the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor and by directly competing with Aca1p and Cst6p for target sites. Sko1p regulates a transcriptional network upon osmotic stress, binding promoters of other transcription factors including MSN2, MOT3, ROX1, MGA1, and GAT2, and also the promoter of the phosphatase encoded by PTP3, a key component of the signal transduction pathway. Sko1p is also important for recruitment of SAGA histone acetylase and SWI/SNF nucleosome-remodeling complexes to osmotic-inducible promoters. Overall, S. cerevisiae contains approximately 40 Sko1p target promoters. ENA1 is a target of Sko1p, and it is responsible for salt regulation via the HOG pathway. Target genes also include SUC2, GRE2, AHP1, SFA1, GLR1, YML131W, and COS8. During hyperosmotic stress, Hog1p MAP kinase associates with target promoters and phosphorylates the amino terminus of Sko1p, disrupting its interaction with the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor and thus converting Sko1p into a transcriptional activator. Sko1p is localized to the nucleaus in unstressed cells, and becomes redistributed to the cytosol upon severe salt stress. Sko1p nuclear localization depends on the stress-inhibited protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates Sko1p near its bZIP domain.	10825197|11401713|12051917|16087739|12086627|11500510|11230135|1437546
YBR182C	SMP1	SMP1 encodes a transcription factor of the MADS family that is primarily involved in the response to osmotic stress. Like other MADS family members, Smp1p bends DNA as it binds; however, the extent of bending is less than is seen for some other family members. Smp1p is phosphorylated by the Hog1p MAP kinase upon osmotic stress, and phosphorylated Smp1p activates transcription of osmotic stress-responsive genes. Smp1p is important for viability in stationary phase, and it accumulates in the nucleus during stationary phase in a Hog1p-dependent manner. Smp1p also has a role in regulation of genes involved in invasive growth and sporulation. Genetic evidence shows that Smp1p is a negative regulator of these genes, but it is unclear whether this is due to direct transcriptional repression. SMP1 has a paralog, RLM1, that encodes a transcription factor involved in cell wall integrity. 	19942851|12509465|12482976|10064699
YMR016C	SOK2	SOK2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the KilA-N family. Sok2p binds to the promoters of many genes involved in filamentous growth, including the transcription factors SWI5, ASH1, MGA1, and the SOK2 paralog PHD1, and the cell wall adhesin genes FLO9 and FLO11. Genetic evidence indicates that Sok2p acts primarily as a transcriptional repressor. Sok2p activity is regulated by the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, and the Yak1p protein kinase is a central player in this regulation.	21521246|16449570|21149646|11046133
YJL127C	SPT10	Spt10p is a transcriptional activator of histone genes, acting in late G1 to provide sufficient core histones for the assembly of the replicated genome into fresh chromatin.  Spt10p binds specifically to histone upstream activating sequence (UAS; 5'-RTTCWDRNWDWTTCKC-3') elements, with the aid of the SBF complex (Swi4 cell cycle box binding factor), and is the only known sequence-specific factor dedicated to histone gene expression. Spt10p forms a homodimer, and two histone UAS elements are required for high-affinity binding by Spt10p. Pairs of histone UAS elements are found only in the major histone promoters. Spt10p contains a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, but definitive evidence of direct HAT activity has proven elusive. Spt21p stimulates Spt10p binding at all four major histone promoters during S phase, particularly at HTA2-HTB2. Spt10p dissociates from histone promoters by the end of S phase.	22345607|22555441
YER148W	SPT15	SPT15 encodes TATA-binding protein (TBP), a general transcription factor of the beta-sheet class. TBP is a component of the RNA polymerase I core factor, TFIID, and TFIIIB, and is essential for positioning the appropriate RNA polymerase at the transcription start site. As a component of the polymerase I core factor, TBP regulates the transcription of rRNA. As a member of the TFIID complex, TBP is required for RNA polymerase II-mediated basal transcription of protein-coding genes and some small nuclear RNAs. As part of TFIIIB, TBP is involved in the transcription of tRNAs, most small nuclear RNAs, and the 5S rRNA. TBP binds the canonical 5'-TATAAAAG-3' sequence, primarily in the minor groove, which unwinds the helix and bends the DNA. TBP self-regulates through the formation of homodimers, which are inactive and must disassociate before the protein is able to bind DNA. Dimer dissociation and TBP/promoter association are the rate-limiting steps in the formation of transcriptional pre-initiation complexes. 	20176488|9932458|11419933|9618449|8413605|12697819
YER161C	SPT2	SPT2 encodes an alpha-helix transcription factor of the high mobility group (HMG). Spt2p binds sequences of the form 5'-TTAAVKAR-3'. Spt2 functions in regulation of the cell cycle, and is a negative regulator associated with transcription elongation, chromatin dynamics, and genome stability.  Spt2p physically interacts with histones and the SWI/SNF complex.	21992532
YDR169C	STB3	STB3 encodes a ribosomal RNA processing element (RRPE; 5'-AAAWTTTT-3') binding transcription factor. RRPEs are commonly found 5' of genes required for ribosome biogenesis and growth in response to addition of glucose to quiescent cells. Stb3p represses a large set of growth genes under poor nutrient conditions or stress. Stb3p also associates with promoters of ribosomal proteins.  Stb3p is restricted to the nucleus by PKA and TORC1 in quiescent cells and is released into the cytoplasm after glucose repletion. Under starvation conditions, Stb3p recruits the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex to ribosomal protein promoters. The details regarding regulation of ribosomal protein and ribosome biogenesis genes remains somewhat enigmatic.	20385783|22964838
YHR178W	STB5	STB5 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Stb5p activates transcription of genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway and the regulation of NADPH production. It is required for normal resistance to acetaldehyde, diamide, and other oxidizing agents. It is also responsive to stress, binding to a wider range of genomic sites under oxidative stress conditions than under normal conditions. Most of the known targets of Stb5p, such as genes of the pentose phosphate and ergosterol biosynthetic pathways and the ATR1 and PRD12 drug efflux pumps, are transcriptionally activated by Stb5p. However, Stb5p represses transcription of at least one gene, PGI1. As a heterodimer with Pdr1p, Stb5p also activates transcription of genes involved in pleiotropic drug resistance, such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter genes PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1, whose products mediate drug efflux from the cell. Stb5p binds to its own promoter, suggesting that its transcription is autoregulated.	16959962|21763361|20806246|19712762|16914749|20738406
YHR084W	STE12	STE12 encodes a helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the homeodomain family.  Ste12p recognizes the pheromone-responsive element (PRE), containing the consensus sequence 5'-TGAAACA-3', and regulates genes involved in vegetative adhesion and mating. Ste12p can also bind centromeres, and regulates the activity of the Cbf1p transcription factor, which is involved in methionine biosynthesis and is itself a constitutive centromere protein. Ste12p is required for mating in haploids, and filamentous growth in diploids.  Dig1p and Dig2p function in discrimination of these two pathways by regulatng the binding activity of Ste12p to mating and filamentation promoters. Ste12p and Tec1p can physically interact and are a model for studying the mechanisms of combinatorial and promoter-specific target gene control. The association of a PRE and a TEA/ATTS consensus sequence (TCS; 5'-RCATTCCY-3'), which is recognized by Tec1p, has been designated a filamentous responsive element (FRE) and allows binding of a Ste12p-Tec1p heterodimer to activate expression of genes involved in filamentation. Ste12p-Tec1p heterodimers can also regulate target genes via single TCS elements, with Tec1p providing the DNA binding and Ste12p the transcriptional activation. During vegetative growth, Dig1p and Dig2p directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of Ste12p and of the Ste12p-Tec1p heterodimer. In response to mating pheromone, the inhibitory functions of Dig1p and Dig2p are relieved by phosphorylation through the mating-specific MAPKs Fus3p and Kss1p, allowing the maximal activation of Ste12p target genes, such as the sexual agglutinin genes or FIG2 cell wall adhesin. 	21521246|23066104|22219507
YDR463W	STP1	STP2 and its paralog STP1 encode transcription factors that are members of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Stp1p and Stp2p act independently of each other but have redundant roles in regulation of genes encoding amino acid and peptide permeases, including AGP1, BAP2, BAP3, DIP5, GNP1,MUP1, TAT1 and TAT2, and PTR2. In response to the presence of extracellular amino acids, they bind to UAS-aa elements in the promoters of their target genes and activate transcription. Stp1p and Stp2p are among several transcription factors involved in nitrogen source utilization (including Uga3p, Dal82p, Stp1p, and Stp2p) whose function depends on cooperation with the transcription factor Dal81p. In the case of Stp1p and Stp2p, Dal81p facilitates their promoter binding and contributes to transcription activation, but is not absolutely required for activity. The involvement of Dal81p in pathways for utilization of several different nitrogen sources allows the cell to integrate the disparate nutritional signals and to induce different pathways according to availability of each source. Activity of Stp1p and Stp2p is regulated by the SPS-sensing pathway, so-called because its first step is sensing by a plasma membrane complex composed of Ssy1p, Ptr3, and Ssy5p. In the absence of extracellular amino acids, Stp1p and Stp2p exist as precursor proteins that are largely cytoplasmic. The small amounts of precursor that do enter the nucleus are prevented from binding to target promoters by three nuclear inner membrane proteins, Asi1p, Asi2p, and Asi3p. Under inducing conditions, the proteolytic activity of Ssy5p is activated and it cleaves inhibitory N-terminal domains from Stp1p and Stp2p. The mature forms of Stp1p and Stp2p are able to enter the nucleus and activate transcription.	22419079|15197729|19143640
YHR006W	STP2	STP2 and its paralog STP1 encode transcription factors that are members of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Stp1p and Stp2p act independently of each other but have redundant roles in regulation of genes encoding amino acid and peptide permeases, including AGP1, BAP2, BAP3, DIP5, GNP1,MUP1, TAT1 and TAT2, and PTR2. In response to the presence of extracellular amino acids, they bind to UAS-aa elements in the promoters of their target genes and activate transcription. Stp1p and Stp2p are among several transcription factors involved in nitrogen source utilization (including Uga3p, Dal82p, Stp1p, and Stp2p) whose function depends on cooperation with the transcription factor Dal81p. In the case of Stp1p and Stp2p, Dal81p facilitates their promoter binding and contributes to transcription activation, but is not absolutely required for activity. The involvement of Dal81p in pathways for utilization of several different nitrogen sources allows the cell to integrate the disparate nutritional signals and to induce different pathways according to availability of each source. Activity of Stp1p and Stp2p is regulated by the SPS-sensing pathway, so-called because its first step is sensing by a plasma membrane complex composed of Ssy1p, Ptr3, and Ssy5p.

The small amounts of precursor that do enter the nucleus are prevented from binding to target promoters by three nuclear inner membrane proteins, Asi1p, Asi2p, and Asi3p. Under inducing conditions, the proteolytic activity of Ssy5p is activated and it cleaves inhibitory N-terminal domains from Stp1p and Stp2p. The mature forms of Stp1p and Stp2p are able to enter the nucleus and activate transcription.	22419079|15197729|19143640
YDR310C	SUM1	SUM1 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the AT-hook family. Sum1p is a major player in the regulation of meiosis and sporulation, repressing meiotic-specific genes until the cell is committed to proceeding through meiosis, and essential for the pachytene checkpoint. One of its targets, NDT80, encodes a transcriptional activator that is central to establishing the commitment to meiosis. Other targets include middle sporulation genes, which are repressed during vegetative growth and early sporulation until their activation mid-way through the sporulation process. Sum1p binds to a subset of middle sporulation elements, MSEs, that are also recognized by the meiotic transcriptional activator Ndt80p; binding of Sum1p and Ndt80p is mutually exclusive. Sum1p binds to some target promoters independently, and at others, it forms a complex with the Hst1p histone deacetylase along with the bridging subunit Rfm1p. Sum1p also represses some non-meiotic targets such as genes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis. In complex with MATa1p, Sum1p represses mating type alpha-specific genes in mating type a cells. In addition to its role in transcription, the Sum1p-Rfm1p-Hst1p complex also binds to DNA replication origins to promote replication initiation. Sum1p repression is alleviated upon phosphorylation of Sum1p by several kinases. 	22390969|18990212|22084423|22106412
YER111C	SWI4	SWI4 encodes a transcription factor of the Ig-fold superfamily, which contacts DNA using a series of flexible loops. As part of the SBF complex (Swi4p/Swi6p cell-cycle box (SCB) binding factor), Swi4p binds and activates G1/S genes with SCB-containing promoters, including G1 cyclins (CLN1, CLN2, PCL1, PCL2) and the HO endonuclease. Swi4p recognizes sequences of the form 5'-ACGCGAAA-3'. Swi4p binding DNA requires association with Swi6p, and is restricted to late M and G1, when Swi6p is located in the nucleus. Free Swi4p is subject to intramolecular interactions that physically prevent DNA binding.  Association with Swi6p induces conformational changes in Swi4p which alleviate this inhibition, allowing Swi4p to bind DNA. SWI4 transcription is activated in late M/early G1 phase by an early cell cycle box (ECB), and the SWI4 promoter also contains binding sites for the SBF and MBF (Mbp1p/Swi6p cell-cycle box (MCB) binding factor) complexes, which confer late G1-specific transcription. This promoter structure ensures that Swi4p activity persists throughout G1, enabling sufficient quantities of its targets to be expressed to promote the transition to S phase. 	23261051|10490612|8649372|12526763
YDR146C	SWI5	SWI5 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. During the M-to-G1 transition in mitosis, Swi5p finalizes mitotic exit by activating transcription of SIC1, which encodes an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase. Other targets of Swi5p activation include EGT2, involved in cell separation; ASH1, encoding a transcriptional repressor that inhibits mating type switching in daughter cells; and HO (YDL227C), encoding the endonuclease required for mating type switching. Swi5p activates HO transcription in concert with the homeodomain transcriptional activator Pho2p, and also recruits the Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator complexes to the HO promoter. Swi5p activity is regulated by its nuclear localization, which in turn is controlled by phosphorylation. During anaphase and early telophase, phosphorylation of the nuclear localization sites of Swi5p, mediated by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase, prevents Swi5p from entering the nucleus. In late telophase, these sites are dephosphorylated by Cdc14p, allowing Swi5 to enter both mother and daughter nuclei. Since Swi5p lacks a nuclear export sequence, it remains in the nuclei until early G1 phase, when it is degraded. Swi5p has a paralog, Ace2p, which also acts at the end of mitosis but regulates a distinct set of genes.	23212898|11562354
YPL128C	TBF1	TBF1 encodes a helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the MYB superfamily. Tbf1p regulates cell cycle and telomere related genes. Tbf1p binds telomeric repeats and participates in telomerase recruitment. Tbf1p inhibits the heterotrimeric MRX complex, which recruits telomerase, from binding to short telomeres. Tbf1p also binds the promoters of the majority of snoRNA genes, and is required for their full expression. Tbf1p binds to a single 5'-ARCCCTAA-3' sequence motif demarcating the upstream border of the snoRNA promoter region. Tbf1p substantially contributes to nucleosome exclusion at non-snoRNA promoters. Tbf1-dependent transcription activation may involve direct interaction with the transcription machinery.	22879408|21468232|20833319
YOR337W	TEA1	TEA1 encodes a zinc-coordinating transcription factor of the fungal zinc cluster family.  Tea1p recognizes motifs of the sequence 5'-GCGSRS-3' and activates transcription of Ty1 retrotransposons. Tea1p may also regulate other genes.	16959962|8524314
YBR083W	TEC1	TEC1 encodes a helix-turn-helix transcription factor of the homeodomain family involved in the regulation of genes involved in the invasive/pseudohyphal growth cascade. Tec1p belongs to the TEA domain (TEAD) family of regulators that control cellular development in many eukaryotes, and recognizes a motif called the TEA/ATTS consensus sequence (TCS), 5'-RCATTCCY-3'. Tec1p and Ste12p can physically interact and are a model for studying the mechanisms of combinatorial and promoter-specific target gene control. The association of a pheromone-responsive element (PRE), containing the consensus sequence 5'-TGAAACA-3' which is recognized by Ste12p, and a TCS has been designated a filamentous responsive element (FRE) and allows binding of a Tec1p-Ste12p heterodimer to activate gene expression. However, Tec1p-Ste12p heterodimers can also regulate target genes via single TCS elements, with Tec1p providing the DNA binding and Ste12p the transcriptional activation.  Tec1p can also activate target genes independently of Ste12p. Tec1p is required for FLO11 expression and for vegetative adhesion. The FLO11 promoter contains both FREs and TCS elements and is bound by Tec1p and Ste12p, though Tec1p is also able to activate FLO11 expression by without Ste12p. During vegetative growth, Dig1p and Dig2p directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of the Tec1p-Ste12p heterodimer. In response to pheromone, the inhibitory functions of Dig1p and Dig2p are relieved by phosphorylation through the mating-specific MAPKs Fus3p and Kss1p.  Fus3p also phosphorylates Tec1p, which induces its degradation by the proteasome and abrogating FLO11 expression, thereby maintaining signaling specificity during the pheromone response.	20139240|21521246
YBR240C	THI2	THI2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Thi2p is required for transcriptional activation of a subset of genes involved in thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP; also known as ThDP) biosynthesis in response to thiamin deprivation. The targets of Thi2p include PHO3, THI4, and THI20. Thi2p can bind independently to target promoters, but its targets are shared with those of the transcription factor Pdc2p, and binding of Thi2p to promoters is enhanced in the presence of Pdc2p and another regulatory protein, Thi3p, that binds both Thi2p and Pdc2p. In the absence of thiamin, Thi3p interaction with Thi2p and Pdc2p allows them to activate transcription, possibly by a conformational change that unmasks their activation domains. In the presence of TPP (i.e., under thiamin-replete conditions), Thi3p binding to TPP releases it from Thi2p and Pdc2p, de-activating them.	22404710|19013460|16850348
YBL054W	TOD6	TOD6 encodes transcription factor that binds PAC (RNA Pol A and C) motifs of the form 5'-GCGATGAGMT-3', which are present in roughly half of all promoters of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. PAC sites function as Dot6p/Tod6p-dependent repressor elements under stress or poor nutrient conditions. Tod6p functions as a transcriptional repressor whose repressive activity is alleviated by phosphorylation in response to nitrogen availability.  Sch9p responds to nitrogen availability and phosphorylates Tod6p. Nitrogen deprivation is thereby sufficient to cause repression of ribosome biogenesis. Tod6p appears to effect repression of ribosome biogenesis gene expression at least in part by recruitment of the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex to ribosome biogenesis gene promoters. The TOR complex I (TORC1) regulates ribosome biogenesis through modulation of Sch9p activity, which affects Tod6p binding to ribosome biogenesis gene promoters.	22964838|21468232
YOR344C	TYE7	TYE7 encodes an E-box-binding zipper-type transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family that recognizes 5'-CACGTGA-3' motifs. Tye7p forms a homodimer and activates the expression of glycolytic genes such as ENO1 and ENO2, as well as GCR1, which encodes a transcriptional activator of glycolytic genes. Tye7p also binds Ty1 retrotransposon DNA and regulates Ty1 sense and antisense transcription in response to adenylic nucleotide reduction. Tye7p has also been implicated in the control of the cell cycle, and of sulfur metabolism.	22379133|17351075|17241460|15789351
YDL170W	UGA3	UGA3 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle.  Uga3p binds as a homodimer to UAS-GABA sequences in the promoters of target genes involved in uptake and utilization of the non-preferred nitrogen source gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA), such as UGA1, encoding GABA transaminase, and UGA4, encoding GABA permease. Transcriptional activation by Uga3p is promoted by GABA, probably because a conformational change upon GABA binding to Uga3p enhances its DNA-binding ability. Uga3p can activate transcription independently under artificial conditions (when overexpressed), but under physiological conditions it is one of several transcription factors involved in nitrogen source utilization (including Dal82p, Stp1p, and Stp2p) whose function depends on cooperation with the transcription factor Dal81p. The involvement of Dal81p in pathways for utilization of several different nitrogen sources allows the cell to integrate the disparate nutritional signals and to induce different pathways according to availability of each source. Binding of Uga3p to target promoters, and recruitment of the transcription coactivators SAGA and Mediator, is promoted by Dal81p. The mechanism by which Dal81p promotes Uga3p function probably involves physical interaction between the two transcription factors, since it does not require the DNA-binding domain of Dal81p.	22419079|21515579|20581295|16959962|22282516
YDR207C	UME6	UME6 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Ume6p is a key regulator of meiosis and sporulation, repressing early meiosis-specific promoters during vegetative growth by binding to upstream repression sequences (URS1) and recruiting the Rpd3p-Sin3p histone deacetylase complex and the Isw2 chromatin remodeling complex. An important target of repression is NDT80, encoding a transcriptional activator that is central to establishing the commitment to meiosis. Ume6p has both positive and negative regulatory targets among genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and may help to coordinate metabolic activity with meiosis. It is also involved in control of the induction of autophagy, via repression of ATG8 transcription. Transcriptional repression by Ume6p during vegetative growth is lifted by Ume6p degradation. In a two-step process, about 50% of Ume6p is destroyed after the transition to nonfermentable carbon sources, in a process that requires Ume6p acetylation by the SAGA acetyltransferase complex. In the absence of a nitrogen source during early meiosis, the remaining Ume6p interacts with the Ime1p transcription factor to trigger its complete destruction.	22084422|22390969|22084423|22733735|22438583|19019152|12370439
YDR213W	UPC2	UPC2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Upc2p and Ecm22p, the products of paralogous genes, have similar functions. They recognize and bind to sterol regulatory elements (SRE) in the promoters of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, such as ERG1, ERG2, ERG3, ERG7, ERG25, ERG26, and ERG27, upregulating their transcription at low sterol levels. Under hypoxic conditions, both Upc2p and Ecm22p also activate transcription of the DAN/TIR genes encoding cell wall mannoproteins. Upc2p also activates transcription of the AUS1 and PDR11 genes encoding transporters that mediate sterol uptake. Under sterol-replete conditions, Upc2p and Ecm22p localize to intracellular membranes. When sterol concentrations are low, both transcription factors relocate to the nucleus to activate ergosterol biosynthetic gene transcription. By analogy to sterol biosynthesis regulators in other organisms, it is likely that Upc2p and Ecm22p are processed during this relocation, such that the C-terminal transmembrane domain remains in the membrane while the N-terminal DNA-binding domain enters the nucleus.	19575637|18675371|16783004|17666007
YPL230W	USV1	USV1 encodes a transcription factor containing a C2H2 zinc finger. Usv1p activates transcription of genes involved in respiratory metabolism, such as ACS1, IDH1, and CIT2, and also activates transcription of the ENA1 gene involved in salt and alkaline pH stress tolerance. In large-scale experiments, Usv1p has been found to be required for hyperosmotic stress resistance, and to bind to the promoter of the FLO11 gene involved in filamentous growth and flocculation. Transcription of USV1 is regulated by the transcription factors Adr1p and Nrg1p. Expression is not detectable during growth on glucose, but is activated on nonfermentable carbon sources and in the presence of high salt. USV1 transcription was also found to be differentially regulated in distinct subpopulations of cells within a growing colony. USV1 has a paralog, RGM1, that encodes a putative transcription factor.	23388641|22560924|19054128|9171100
YIL056W	VHR1	VHR1 encodes a transcription factor that lacks overall similarity to other known transcription regulators, although it contains a predicted helix-turn-helix motif in its N-terminal DNA binding domain. Under low biotin conditions, Vhr1p activates transcription of the VHT1 and BIO5 genes, involved respectively in the uptake of biotin and of a biotin precursor. Vhr1p also recruits the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to the VHT1 and BIO5 promoters, which is essential for activation of their transcription.	16533810|21278159
YML076C	WAR1	WAR1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. War1p activates transcription in response to weak acid stress, and its principal target is PDR12, which encodes a plasma membrane transporter that actively transports weak acids out of the cell. War1p binds constitutively, as a homodimer, to the WARE (weak acid response element) of the PDR12 promoter. Its transcription factor activity is regulated by binding of weak acid anions such as sorbate, benzoate, or propionate, which causes a conformational change that unmasks the transcriptional activation domain. War1p is also regulated by phosphorylation in response to the presence of weak acids.	22084422|17052200|16959962|22050823|20955006
YIL101C	XBP1	XBP1 encodes a transcriptional repressor that regulates the cell cycle and binds 5'-YTCGAR-3' motifs in the promoters of target genes. XBP1 is induced during sporuation and reduces the transcription of CLN1 to stimulate sporulation. XBP1 is induced by stress and starvation. Xbp1p regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) through regulation of histone H4 acetylation and nucleosome displacement, and physically and genetically interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3 complex. Cdc28p phosphorylates Xbp1p at residues Ser146, Ser271 and Ser551. In response to DNA damage, Xbp1p is upregulated in a Mec1-Rad9-Rad53 checkpoint pathway-dependent manner and undergoes dephosphorylation, which promotes its association with the Rpd3 complex and subsequent recruitment to DSBs.	22219709|21467995
YML007W	YAP1	YAP1 encodes an AP-1 type transcription factor which contains a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), and binds to a consensus Yap1p recognition element (YRE; 5'-TT/GAC/GTC/AA-3'). Yap1p is a key player in the cellular response to oxidative stress and xenobiotic insults, including drugs and heavy metals. The leader sequence of the YAP1 mRNA contains an upstream open reading frame (uORF), that allows leaky ribosomal scanning and reinitiation to the main ORF.  Activation of Yap1p occurs in response to oxidants, particularly hydrogen peroxide.  The activity of Yap1p is mainly regulated at the level of its export from the nucleus. Under normal conditions Yap1p is freely distributed between cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly it is localized in the cytosol due to its active export from the nucleus by Crm1p, which binds a nuclear export signal (NES) in the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Yap1p. Yap1p is activated by glutathione (GSH) peroxidase Hyr1p, which induces a conformational change and masks the NES contained in the C-terminal CRD, thereby inhibiting Yap1p-Crm1p bond formation. Once back in the nucleus, Yap1p initiates the transcription of specific genes by binding to the YREs contained in their promoter sequences. Yap1p promotes the transcription of several genes encoding antioxidants or antioxidant-associated molecules, such as those involved in the thioredoxin (TRX) and GSH systems, including AHP1, TRR1, TRX2, TSA1, GPX2, GSH1, GSH2, GLR1, SOD1, and SOD2. Yap1p can also be activated in response to diamide, and regulates the response to cadmium by upregulating transcription of transporter YCF1.  Other target genes encoding transporters include ATR1 and FLR1.	20959147|22737670|20148391
YHL009C	YAP3	YAP3 encodes an AP-1 type transcription factor which contains a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), and activates transcription from promoters containing a Yap recognition element (YRE; 5'-TTAC/GTAA-3').  Little is known about the regulatory targets of Yap3p, but it appears to play a specific role in the cellular response to hydroquinone (HQ). Like other Yap family members, Yap3p contains two cysteine-rich domains (CRD), and also contains a nuclear export signal (NES) in its C-terminus.  Yap3p is retained in the nucleus only following treatment with HQ. Yap3p may also respond to ER stress, as null mutants are sensitive to tunicamycin, a compound that causes ER stress through induction of the unfolded protein response.  Null mutants are also sensitive to arsenic treatment, and some work suggests that Yap3p sites co-occur with those of Arr1p (Yap8p), the major arsenic response transcription factor.	9372930|20148391|21549177|21912624
YIR018W	YAP5	YAP5 encodes an AP-1 type transcription factor which contains a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), and binds to a consensus cis-acting Yap recognition element (YRE; 5'-TTAC/GTAA-3'). Yap5p is the only member of the Yap family that regulates the expression of vacuolar iron transport in response to cytosolic iron, and is responsible for the high-iron induction of CCC1, which encodes a vacuolar iron transporter. Yap5p is constitutively localized to the nucleus even in the absense of iron, and binding of Yap5p to the CCC1 promoter is iron independent, but transcriptional activation does require iron. Yap5p regulates the expression of glutaredoxin GRX4 in a similar manner; binding to its promoter is iron-independent, while activation of transcription is iron-dependent. Yap5p also mediates induction of TYW1, a gene that encodes an iron-sulfur cluster enzyme that participates in the synthesis of wybutosine modified tRNA, thereby providing cellular protection from high iron toxicity by the consumption of free cytosolic iron through the formation of protein-bound iron-sulfur clusters. A limited number of other genes have also been identified as Yap5p targets: CUP1, YHB1, PHO3, and GDH1.	18070921|20148391|22616008|21917924
YDR259C	YAP6	YAP6 encodes an AP-1 type transcription factor which contains a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP), and binds to a consensus cis-acting Yap recognition element (YRE; 5'-TTAC/GTAA-3'). Yap6p is involved in the regulation of the osmotic stress response, and binds the promoters of dozens of genes, including those involved in the transport and catabolism of sugars and carbohydrates, and also those of ribosomal protein genes.  In addition, Yap6p binds the promoters of over 40 different transcription factors, including its own. Yap6p is constitutively nuclear, and is induced upon exposure to various stress conditions, including osmotic and oxidative stress, and temperature shift. The YAP6 promotor is particularly rich in a variety of stress-associated cis-elements, including a YRE, a stress response elements (STRE), and three heat shock elements (HSE), enabling induction by multiple signalling pathways.	19487574|20148391
YDR451C	YHP1	YHP1 encodes a helix-turn-helix transcriptional repressor of the homeodomain family. Yhp1p regulates gene expression that occurs late in the cell cycle, and restricts transcription of genes containing early cell cycle boxes (ECBs) to M-G1 phase. Yhp1p is an ancillary transcription factor that binds alongside Mcm1p on promoters. Examples include important cell cycle genes such as SWI4 and CLN3, themselves rate-limiting for cell cycle progression, and essential for the control of subsequent waves of gene expression at G1-S. Removal of Yhp1p from promoters allows gene expression at M-G1. Transcription of YHP1 is activated by the Hcm1p forkhead-like transcription factor.  Yhp1p is expressed later in the cell cycle and helps to maintain ECB repression until late M-phase.	21310294|16285853
YML027W	YOX1	YOX1 encodes a helix-turn-helix transcriptional repressor of the homeodomain family. Yox1p restricts transcription of genes containing early cell cycle boxes (ECBs) to M-G1 phase. Yox1p is an ancillary transcription factor that binds alongside Mcm1p on promoters.  Examples include important cell cycle genes such as SWI4 and CLN3, themselves rate-limiting for cell cycle progression, and essential for the control of subsequent waves of gene expression at G1-S. Yox1p binds upstream of genes involved in spindle function, DNA synthesis and repair, and also associates with a small portion of intergenic regions adjacent to tRNA genes. Removal of Yox1p from promoters allows gene expression at M-G1. YOX1 is under transcriptional regulation by SBF, and Mcm1p controls the expression of SWI4 which encodes a component of SBF, thereby setting up a negative feedback loop. The transcription of the CDC20 APC (anaphase promoting complex) activator is repressed by Yox1p and kept very low during S phase.  Upon mitotic onset, Yox1p abundance declines and the CDC20 gene is actively transcribed. Cdc28p negatively regulates YOX1 transcription, thereby keeping intracellular levels of Yox1p low, and promoting the transcription of CDC20. Yox1p is an unstable protein, so that suppression of its transcription results in rapid reduction of intracellular protein levels.	23063749|22754627|21310294
YOR172W	YRM1	YRM1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Yrm1p can function as a transcriptional activator for genes involved in multidrug resistance, but apparently is functional only in the absence of its paralog YRR1. Promoter binding by Yrm1p is not observed in wild type, but in a yrr1 mutant strain, Yrm1p binds to the promoters of a set of genes overlapping with, but not identical to, Yrr1p targets. This suggests that interaction between Yrm1p and Yrr1p may abolish the DNA-binding activity of Yrm1p. Conversely, overproduction of Yrm1p reduces the transcriptional activation activity of Yrr1p.	14512416
YOR162C	YRR1	YRR1 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Active as a homodimer, Yrr1p binds to Yrr1p response elements (YRREs) upstream of its target genes. Yrr1p has an important role in drug resistance, via upregulation of genes encoding drug efflux pumps such as the ATP-binding cassette transporters Snq2p and Yor1p and the major facilitator superfamily transporter Flr1p. YRR1 transcription is autoregulated, and Yrr1p activity is negatively regulated, apparently at a post-transcriptional level, by its paralog Yrm1p.	16959962|19150512|16406363|18086556|11909958|14512416
YJL056C	ZAP1	ZAP1 encodes a zinc-sensing transcription factor that regulates the cellular response to zinc deficiency. Under zinc depletion, Zap1p activates transcription of ~80 genes, and represses expression of a small number of genes. Zap1p target genes are involved in zinc homeostasis and metabolic adaptation to zinc deficiency. Zap1p is inactivated when zinc is in abundance. Zap1p contains a DNA-binding domain and multiple transcription activation domains, all of which bind zinc. The DNA binding domain is located toward the C-terminus and consists of five C2H2 zinc fingers. In zinc-deficient cells, Zap1p binds as a monomer to a palindromic zinc-responsive element (ZRE), 5'-ACCTTNAAGGT-3'. Zap1p-regulated promoters typically contain one or a few recognizable ZREs. The ZAP1 gene contains a ZRE and is activated by Zap1p, thereby increasing the amount of cellular Zap1p during zinc limitation. ZREs with the highest binding affinity for Zap1p tend to appear in genes activated by mild iron deficiency, which suggests that Zap1p occupies lower-affinity sites only when the Zap1p levels rise, as they do in severe zinc deficiency. Zap1p regulates expression of zinc transporters that transfer extracellular zinc into the cell and the vacuolar zinc to the cytosol. Zrt1p and Zrt2p are high- and low-affinity zinc transporters of the ZIP family. ZRT2 is repressed by Zap1p under conditions of severe zinc limitation. This repression is mediated through a lower-affinity ZRE in the ZRT2 promoter. Activation of ZRT2 is mediated by Zap1p binding to high-affinity ZREs located upstream of the TATA box. Severe zinc deficiency increases the levels of Zap1p through autoactivation of its own promoter. Zap1p can then also bind to a lower affinity ZRE located near the transcription start site of ZRT2, inhibiting transcription. Under conditions where zinc levels are too low for ZRT2 to function, expression is repressed. In zinc-replete conditions, zinc storage is mediated by two transporters on the vacuolar membrane, Cot1p and Zrc1p. Under conditions of zinc deficiency, vacuolar zinc stores are mobilized through the activity of Zrt3p, a ZIP family transporter on the vacuolar membrane. ZRC1 is also induced by Zap1p during zinc deficiency as a protective measure for cells exposed to sudden influx of zinc produced by expression of uptake systems at high levels. Fet4p is a low-affinity, broad-specificity metal transporter, the expression of which is induced by Zap1p under zinc-limiting conditions. Zrg17p, part of a heterodimeric transporter with Msc2p that transfers zinc from the cytosol to the ER lumen, and member of the cation diffusion facilitator family of efflux pumps, is also zinc-regulated directly through Zap1p.	23463800
YLL054C		YLL054C encodes a putative transcription factor that is a member of the C6 zinc finger class, containing a DNA binding domain also known as the Zn2Cys6 binuclear zinc cluster or zinc knuckle. Its putative DNA-binding domain was experimentally shown to bind DNA in large-scale studies. The yll054c null mutation blocks the ability to grow on glycerol or lactate carbon source, indicating a defect in respiratory metabolism, and confers sensitivity to Calcofluor White, suggesting cell wall defects.	11353088|9290251|19158363|19111667
YPR015C		YPR015C encodes a putative transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class, containing two tandemly-arranged zinc fingers. Overexpression of Ypr015cp confers a growth defect, and genome-wide expression analysis suggests that it may act primarily as a transcriptional repressor.	18366603
